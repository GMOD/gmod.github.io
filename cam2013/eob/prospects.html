## ***Future development***

  

### 

- Current active version has much functionality added under tight time
  constraints; it works but the code is messy.
- Code is currently being tightened and documented.
- Currently testing resilience and usability of system with real data,
  multiple users; feedback is anticipated.
- We anticipate possibly expanding the system to more curators, e.g.
  external experts having access to particular families of genes.
