**Thank you for participating in the 2013 Generic Model Organism
Database (GMOD) community survey!**

The GMOD project provides free, open-source bioinformatics software and
support to a huge, diverse community of users around the globe. This
survey aims to find out how you are using GMOD, what you find useful (or
otherwise), what support you need, and some information on the GMOD
components you use. The responses gathered in this survey will help us
to serve our user community more effectively and to suggest future
directions for the GMOD project.

Participants who enter an email address will be entered into a prize
draw; the winner can choose between a [Journey Through Your DNA genetic
testing kit from 23andMe](https://www.23andme.com/store/cart/) or a \$50
Amazon gift voucher.

The survey will be open until March 8th, 2013. The survey results will
be discussed at the
<a href="wiki/April_2013_GMOD_Meeting" rel="external">2013 GMOD
Community Meeting in Cambridge, UK</a> , and documented on the GMOD
wiki.

This survey should take between ten and fifteen minutes to complete. All
responses are anonymous and completely confidential, and responses will
not be identified by individual. All questions are optional, but the
more information you give, the better we are able to serve our
community.

### Navigating the survey

The survey is split into two sections; the first has more general
questions, and the second has questions on specific GMOD components.

We recommend that you enable JavaScript in your browser to enable paging
through the survey. Use the page numbers or the "Prev" and "Next" links
to navigate between pages, and click the "Submit" button on the last
page of each section to submit your responses.

After completing the two survey sections, you have the option to submit
your name and email address for entry into a draw to win a genome test
from 23andMe. Your email address will not be connected to your survey
responses or used for any other purpose.

### Contact

If you have any questions or technical issues with the survey, please
contact Amelia Ireland at <help@gmod.org> .

**Thank you for your help!**
