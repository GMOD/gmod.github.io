## <span id="Using_WebApollo" class="mw-headline">Using WebApollo</span>

We've made some configuration modifications after the original AMI was
created, so run the following commands in your VM:

    $ cd
    $ wget icebox.lbl.gov/webapollo/gmod/2014/summer_school/new_config.tgz
    $ cd /var/lib/tomcat7/webapps/WebApolloDemo/config
    $ tar -xvzf ~/new_config.tgz
    $ sudo service tomcat7 restart

WebApollo is a web-based application, so the only requirement to use it
is a web browser. It has been tested with Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
It has not been tested with Internet Explorer.

A WebApollo demo with the Pythium data has been set up on the virtual
machine. We'll use the demo to view WebApollo's functionality.

Point your browser to
`http://ec2-##-##-##-##.compute-1.amazonaws.com/WebApolloDemo`.  
(e.g.,
`http://ec2-184-73-92-243.compute-1.amazonaws.com/WebApolloDemo`).

Note: All prerequisites have already been installed on the course's
machine

### <span id="Installation" class="mw-headline">Installation</span>

The installation steps will be done in the command line. SSH into your
AWS machine. Uncompress the WebApollo-2014-04-03.tgz tarball.

    $ cd
    $ tar -xvzf sources/WebApollo-2014-04-03.tgz

### <span id="User_database" class="mw-headline">User database</span>

WebApollo uses a database to determine who can access and edit
annotations for a given sequence.

First we’ll need to create a database. You can call it whatever you want
(remember the name as you’ll need to point the configuration to it). For
the purposes of this guide, we’ll call it `web_apollo_users`. You might
want to create a separate account to manage the database. We’ll have the
user `web_apollo_db` with password `web_apollo_db`. The user will not be
a superuser nor will it be able to create new roles. But it will be able
to create databases.

    $ createuser -P web_apollo_db
    Enter password for new role: 
    Enter it again: 
    Shall the new role be a superuser? (y/n) n
    Shall the new role be allowed to create databases? (y/n) y
    Shall the new role be allowed to create more new roles? (y/n) n

Next we'll create the user database.

    $ createdb -U web_apollo_db web_apollo_users

Now that the database is created, we need to load the schema to it.

    $ cd ~/WebApollo-2014-04-03/tools/user
    $ psql -U web_apollo_db web_apollo_users < user_database_postgresql.sql

Now the user database has been setup.

Let's populate the database.

First we’ll create an user with access to WebApollo. We’ll use the
`add_user.pl` script in `~/WebApollo-2014-04-03/tools/user`. Let’s
create an user named `web_apollo_admin` with the password
`web_apollo_admin`.

    $ ./add_user.pl -D web_apollo_users -U web_apollo_db -P web_apollo_db \
    -u web_apollo_admin -p web_apollo_admin

Next we’ll add the annotation tracks ids for the genomic sequences for
our organism. We’ll use the `add_tracks.pl` script in the same
directory. We need to generate a file of genomic sequence ids for the
script. For convenience, there’s a script called
`extract_seqids_from_fasta.pl` in the same directory which will go
through a FASTA file and extract all the ids from the deflines. Let’s
first create the list of genomic sequence ids. We'll store it in
`~/scratch/seqids.txt`. We’ll want to add the prefix “Annotations-” to
each identifier.

    $ mkdir ~/scratch
    $ ./extract_seqids_from_fasta.pl -p Annotations- -i ~/sample_data/pyu_data/scf1117875582023.fa \
    -o ~/scratch/seqids.txt

Now we’ll add those ids to the user database.

    $ ./add_tracks.pl -D web_apollo_users -U web_apollo_db -P web_apollo_db \
    -t ~/scratch/seqids.txt

Now that we have an user created and the annotation track ids loaded,
we’ll need to give the user permissions to access the sequence. We’ll
have the all permissions (read, write, publish, user manager). We’ll use
the `set_track_permissions.pl` script in the same directory. We’ll need
to provide the script a list of genomic sequence ids, like in the
previous step.

    $ ./set_track_permissions.pl -D web_apollo_users -U web_apollo_db \
    -P web_apollo_db -u web_apollo_admin -t ~/scratch/seqids.txt -a

We’re all done setting up the user database.

Note that we’re only using a subset of the options for all the scripts
mentioned above. You can get more detailed information on any given
script (and other available options) using the “-h” or “--help” flag
when running the script.

## <span id="Deploying_the_servlet" class="mw-headline">Deploying the servlet</span>

### <span id="Tomcat_error_handling" class="mw-headline">Tomcat error handling</span>

Note that WebApollo server sends error to the client through JSON
messages. Your servlet container must be configured to allow raw JSON to
be sent as when errors occur. In the case of Tomcat, you'll need to
configure it to use the custom valve that is provided with the WebApollo
package. This step only needs to be done once per Tomcat server.

This step has already been done.

    $ cp ~/WebApollo-2014-04-03/tomcat/custom-valves.jar /usr/share/tomcat7/lib

You'll then need to add
`errorReportValveClass="org.bbop.apollo.web.ErrorReportValve"` as an
attribute to the existing `<Host>` element in `/etc/tomcat7/server.xml`

    <Host name="localhost" appBase="webapps" 
          unpackWARs="true" autoDeploy="true" 
          errorReportValveClass="org.bbop.apollo.web.ErrorReportValve">
    </Host>

### <span id="Deploying_the_WAR" class="mw-headline">Deploying the WAR</span>

We need to deploy the WAR file in the war directory from the unpacked
tarball.

    $ cd /var/lib/tomcat7/webapps

Next we need to create the directory that will contain the application.

    $ sudo mkdir WebApollo

Let's make `ubuntu` the owner of the newly created directory, so that we
don't have to constantly run commands as root.

    $ sudo chown ubuntu WebApollo

Now we'll go into the newly created directory and unpack the WAR file
into it.

    $ cd WebApollo
    $ jar -xvf ~/WebApollo-2014-04-03/war/WebApollo.war

That’s it! We’re done installing WebApollo. Now we need to move on to
configuring the application.

## <span id="Configuration" class="mw-headline">Configuration</span>

Most configuration files will reside in
`/var/lib/tomcat7/webapps/WebApollo/config`. We’ll need to configure a
number of things before we can get WebApollo up and running.

### <span id="Supported_annotation_types" class="mw-headline">Supported annotation types</span>

Many configurations will require you to define which annotation types
the configuration will apply to. WebApollo supports the following
"higher level" types (from the Sequence Ontology):

- sequence:gene
- sequence:pseudogene
- sequence:transcript
- sequence:mRNA
- sequence:tRNA
- sequence:snRNA
- sequence:snoRNA
- sequence:ncRNA
- sequence:rRNA
- sequence:miRNA
- sequence:repeat_region
- sequence:transposable_element

### <span id="Main_configuration" class="mw-headline">Main configuration</span>

The main configuration is stored in
`/var/lib/tomcat7/webapps/WebApollo/config/config.xml`. Let’s take a
look at the file.

</server_configuration>
```


Let’s look through each element in more detail with values filled in.


``` de1
<!-- mapping configuration for GBOL data structures -->
<gbol_mapping>/config/mapping.xml</gbol_mapping>
```


File that contains type mappings used by the underlying data model. It’s
best not to change the default option.


``` de1
<!-- directory where JE database will be created -->
<datastore_directory>/data/webapollo/annotations</datastore_directory>
```


Directory where user generated annotations will be stored. The data is
stored using Berkeley DB. We'll use `/data/webapollo/annotations`.


``` de1
<!-- minimum size for introns created -->
<default_minimum_intron_size>1</default_minimum_intron_size>
```


Minimum length of intron to be created when using the “Make intron”
operation. The operation will try to make the shortest intron that’s at
least as long as this parameter. So if you set it to a value of “40”,
then all calculated introns will be at least of length 40.


``` de1
<!-- size of history for each feature - setting to 0 means unlimited history -->
<history_size>0</history_size>
```


The size of your history stack, meaning how many “Undo/Redo” steps you
can do. The larger the number, the larger the storage space needed.
Setting it to “0” makes it to that there’s no limit.


``` de1
<!-- overlapping strategy for adding transcripts to genes -->
<overlapper_class>org.bbop.apollo.web.overlap.OrfOverlapper</overlapper_class>
```


Defines the strategy to be used for deciding whether overlapping
transcripts should be considered splice variants to the same gene. This
points to a Java class implementing the
`org.bbop.apollo.overlap.Overlapper` interface. This allows you to
create your own custom overlapping strategy should the need arise.
Currently available options are:

- `org.bbop.apollo.web.overlap.NoOverlapper`
  - No transcripts should be considered splice variants, regardless of
    overlap.
- `org.bbop.apollo.web.overlap.SimpleOverlapper`
  - Any overlapping of transcripts will cause them to be part of the
    same gene
- `org.bbop.apollo.web.overlap.OrfOverlapper`
  - Only transcripts that overlap within the coding region and within
    frame are considered part of the same gene


``` de1
<!-- javascript file for comparing track names (refseqs) (used for sorting in selection table) -->
<track_name_comparator>/config/track_name_comparator.js</track_name_comparator>
```


Defines how to compare genomic sequence names for sorting purposes in
the genomic region selection list. Points to a javascript file. You can
implement your logic to allow whatever sorting you’d like for your own
organism. This doesn't make much of a difference in our case since we're
only dealing with one genomic region. The default behavior is to sort
names lexicographically.


``` de1
<!-- whether to use an existing CDS when creating new transcripts -->
<use_cds_for_new_transcripts>true</use_cds_for_new_transcripts>
```


Tells WebApollo whether to use an existing CDS when creating a new
transcript (otherwise it computes the longest ORF). This can be useful
when gene predictors suggest a CDS that's not the longest ORF and you
want to use that instead. This is only applicable when using features
that have a CDS associated with them.


``` de1
<!-- set to false to use hybrid disk/memory store which provides a little slower performance
but uses a lot less memory - great for annotation rich genomes -->
<use_pure_memory_store>true</use_pure_memory_store>
```


Defines whether the internal data store is purely a memory one or a
hybrid memory/disk store. The memory store provides faster performance
at the cost of more memory. The hybrid store provides a little slower
performance but uses a lot less memory, so it's a good option for
annotation rich genomes. Set to `true` to use the memory store and
`false` to use the hybrid one.

Let’s take look at the `user` element, which handles configuration for
user authentication and permission handling.


``` de1
<!-- user authentication/permission configuration -->
<user>
 
    <!-- database configuration -->
    <database>
 
        <!-- driver for user database -->
        <driver>org.postgresql.Driver</driver>
 
        <!-- JDBC URL for user database -->
        <url>ENTER_USER_DATABASE_JDBC_URL</url>
 
        <!-- username for user database -->
        <username>ENTER_USER_DATABASE_USERNAME</username>
 
        <!-- password for user database -->
        <password>ENTER_USER_DATABASE_PASSWORD</password>
 
    </database>
 
    <!-- class for generating user authentication page (login page) -->
    <authentication_class>org.bbop.apollo.web.user.localdb.LocalDbUserAuthentication</authentication_class>
 
</user>
```


Let’s first look at the `database` element that defines the database
that will handle user permissions (which we created previously).


``` de1
<!-- driver for user database -->
<driver>org.postgresql.Driver</driver>
```


This should point the JDBC driver for communicating with the database.
We’re using a PostgreSQL driver since that’s the database we’re using
for user permission management.


``` de1
<!-- JDBC URL for user database -->
<url>jdbc:postgresql://localhost/web_apollo_users</url>
```


JDBC URL to the user permission database. We'll use
`jdbc:postgresql://localhost/web_apollo_users` since the database is
running in the same server as the annotation editing engine and we named
the database `web_apollo_users`.


``` de1
<!-- username for user database -->
<username>web_apollo_db</username>
```


User name that has read/write access to the user database. The user with
access to the user database has the user name `web_apollo_db`.


``` de1
<!-- password for user database -->
<password>web_apollo_db</password>
```


Password to access user database. The user with access to the user
database has the password \</tt\>web_apollo_db\</tt\>.

Now let’s look at the other elements in the `user` element.


``` de1
<!-- class for generating user authentication page (login page) -->
<authentication_class>org.bbop.apollo.web.user.localdb.LocalDbUserAuthentication</authentication_class>
```


Defines how user authentication is handled. This points to a class
implementing the `org.bbop.apollo.web.user.UserAuthentication`
interface. This allows you to implement any type of authentication you’d
like (e.g., LDAP). Currently available options are:

- `org.bbop.apollo.web.user.localdb.LocalDbUserAuthentication`
  - Uses the user permission database to also store authentication
    information, meaning it stores user passwords in the database
- `org.bbop.apollo.web.user.browserid.BrowserIdUserAuthentication`
  - Uses Mozilla’s
    <a href="https://https://login.persona.org" class="external text"
    rel="nofollow">Persona</a> service for authentication. This has the
    benefits of offloading all authentication security to Mozilla and
    allows one account to have access to multiple resources (as long as
    they have Persona support). Being that the service is provided
    through Mozilla, it will require users to create a Persona account

Now let’s look at the configuration for accessing the annotation tracks
for the genomic sequences.


``` de1
<tracks>
 
    <!-- path to JBrowse refSeqs.json file -->
    <refseqs>ENTER_PATH_TO_REFSEQS_JSON_FILE</refseqs>
 
    <!-- annotation track name the current convention is to append
     the genomic region id to the the name of the annotation track
     e.g., if the annotation track is called "Annotations" and the
     genomic region is chr2L, the track name will be
     "Annotations-chr2L".-->
    <annotation_track_name>Annotations</annotation_track_name>
 
    <!-- organism being annotated -->
    <organism>ENTER_ORGANISM</organism>
 
    <!-- CV term for the genomic sequences - should be in the form
     of "CV:term".  This applies to all sequences -->
    <sequence_type>ENTER_CVTERM_FOR_SEQUENCE</sequence_type>
 
    <!-- path to file containing translation table.
     optional - defaults to NCBI translation table 1 if absent -->
    <translation_table>/config/translation_tables/ncbi_1_translation_table.txt</translation_table>
 
    <!-- splice acceptor and donor sites. Multiple entries may be
     added to allow multiple accepted sites.
     optional - defaults to GT for donor and AG for acceptor
     if absent -->
    <splice_sites>
        <donor_site>GT</donor_site>
        <acceptor_site>AG</acceptor_site>
    </splice_sites>
 
</tracks>
```


Let’s look at each element individually.


``` de1
<!-- path to JBrowse refSeqs.json file -->
<refseqs>/var/lib/tomcat7/webapps/WebApollo/jbrowse/data/seq/refSeqs.json</refseqs>
```


Location where the `refSeqs.json` file resides, which is created from
the data generation pipeline (see the [data
generation](#Data_generation) section). By default, the JBrowse data
needs to reside in `/var/lib/tomcat7/webapps/WebApollo/jbrowse/data`. If
you want the data to reside elsewhere, you’ll need to do configure your
servlet container to handle the appropriate alias to `jbrowse/data` or
symlink the `data` directory to somewhere else. WebApollo is
pre-configured to allow symlinks.


``` de1
<annotation_track_name>Annotations</annotation_track_name>
```


Name of the annotation track. Leave it as the default value of
`Annotations`.


``` de1
<!-- organism being annotated -->
<organism>Pythium ultimum</organism>
```


Scientific name of the organism being annotated (genus and species).
We're annotating `Pythium ultimum`.


``` de1
<!-- CV term for the genomic sequences - should be in the form
 of "CV:term".  This applies to all sequences -->
<sequence_type>sequence:contig</sequence_type>
```


The type for the genomic sequences. Should be in the form of `CV:term`.
Our genomic sequences are of the type `sequence:contig`.


``` de1
<!-- path to file containing translation table.
 optional - defaults to NCBI translation table 1 if absent -->
<translation_table>/config/translation_tables/ncbi_1_translation_table.txt</translation_table>
```


File that contains the codon translation table. This is optional and
defaults to NCBI translation table 1 if absent. See the [translation
tables](#Translation_tables) section for details on which tables are
available and how to customize your own table.


``` de1
<!-- splice acceptor and donor sites. Multiple entries may be
 added to allow multiple accepted sites.
 optional - defaults to GT for donor and AG for acceptor
 if absent -->
<splice_sites>
    <donor_site>GT</donor_site>
    <acceptor_site>AG</acceptor_site>
</splice_sites>
```


Defines what the accepted donor and acceptor splice sites are. This will
determine whether the client displays a warning on splice sites (if the
splice site sequence doesn't match what's defined here, then it flags
the splice site). You can add multiple `<donor_site>` and
`<acceptor_site>` elements if your organism should support multiple
values. This is optional and defaults to `GT` for donor and `AG` for
acceptor sites.


``` de1
<!-- path to file containing canned comments XML -->
<canned_comments>/config/canned_comments.xml</canned_comments>
```


File that contains canned comments (predefined comments that will be
available from a pull-down menu when creating comments). It’s best not
to change the default option. See the [canned
comments](#Canned_comments) section for details on configuring canned
comments.


``` de1
<!-- configuration for what to display in the annotation info editor.
Sections can be commented out to not be displayed or uncommented
to make them active -->
<annotation_info_editor>
 
    <!-- grouping for the configuration.  The "feature_types" attribute takes a list of
 SO terms (comma separated) to apply this configuration to
 (e.g., feature_types="sequence:transcript,sequence:mRNA" will make it so the group
 configuration will only apply to features of type "sequence:transcript" or "sequence:mRNA").
 A value of "default" will make this the default configuration for any types not explicitly
 defined in other groups.  You can have any many groups as you'd like -->
    <annotation_info_editor_group feature_types="default">
 
        <!-- display status section.  The text for each <status_flag>
     element will be displayed as a radio button in the status
     section, in the same order -->
        <!--
     <status>
         <status_flag>Approved</status_flag>
         <status_flag>Needs review</status_flag>
     </status>
     -->
 
        <!-- display generic attributes section -->
        <attributes />
 
        <!-- display dbxrefs section -->
        <dbxrefs />
 
        <!-- display PubMed IDs section -->
        <pubmed_ids />
 
        <!-- display GO IDs section -->
        <go_ids />
 
        <!-- display comments section -->
        <comments />
 
    </annotation_info_editor_group>
 
</annotation_info_editor>
```


Here's the configuration on what to display in the annotation info
editor. It will always display `Name`, `Symbol`, and `Description` but
the rest is optional. This allows you to make the editor more compact if
you're not interested in editing certain metadata. Let's look at the
options in more detail.


``` de1
<!-- grouping for the configuration.  The "feature_types" attribute takes a list of
SO terms (comma separated) to apply this configuration to
(e.g., feature_types="sequence:transcript,sequence:mRNA" will make it so the group
configuration will only apply to features of type "sequence:transcript" or "sequence:mRNA").
A value of "default" will make this the default configuration for any types not explicitly
defined in other groups.  You can have any many groups as you'd like -->
<annotation_info_editor_group feature_types="default">
    ...
</annotation_info_editor_group>
```


Each configuration is grouped by annotation type. This allows you to
have different options on what's displayed for specified types. The
`feature_types` attribute defines which types this group will apply to.
`feature_types` takes a list of SO terms (comma separated), such as
`"sequence:transcript,sequence:mRNA"`, which will apply this
configuration to annotations of type `sequence:transcript` and
`sequence:mRNA`. Alternatively, you can set the value to `"default"`
which will become the default configuration for any types not explicitly
defined in other groups. You can have any many groups as you'd like. All
[supported annotation types](#Supported_annotation_types) can be used.

Next, let's look at each item to configure in each group.


``` de1
<!-- display status section.  The text for each <status_flag>
 element will be displayed as a radio button in the status
 section, in the same order -->
<status>
    <status_flag>Approved</status_flag>
    <status_flag>Needs review</status_flag>
</status>
```


Allows selecting the status for a particular annotation. The value for
`<status_flag>` is arbitrary (you can enter any text) and you can add as
many as you'd like, but you need to at least have one (they'll show up
as selectable buttons in the editor).


``` de1
<!-- display generic attributes section -->
<attributes />
```


Allows editing of generic attributes (tag/value pairs). Think
non-reserved GFF3 tags for column 9.


``` de1
<!-- display dbxrefs section -->
<dbxrefs />
```


Allows editing of database cross references.


``` de1
<!-- display PubMed IDs section -->
<pubmed_ids />
```


Allows editing of PubMed IDs (for associating an annotation with a
publication).


``` de1
<!-- display GO IDs section -->
<go_ids />
```


Allows editing of Gene Ontology terms (for associating an annotation to
a particular function).


``` de1
<!-- display comments section -->
<comments />
```


Allows editing of comments for annotations.


``` de1
<!-- tools to be used for sequence searching.  This is optional.
 If this is not setup, WebApollo will not have sequence search support -->
<sequence_search_tools>
 
    <!-- one <sequence_search_tool> element per tool -->
    <sequence_search_tool>
 
        <!-- display name for the search tool -->
        <key>BLAT nucleotide</key>
 
        <!-- class for handling search -->
        <class>org.bbop.apollo.tools.seq.search.blat.BlatCommandLineNucleotideToNucleotide</class>
 
        <!-- configuration for search tool -->
        <config>/config/blat_config.xml</config>
 
    </sequence_search_tool>
 
    <sequence_search_tool>
 
        <!-- display name for the search tool -->
        <key>BLAT protein</key>
 
        <!-- class for handling search -->
        <class>org.bbop.apollo.tools.seq.search.blat.BlatCommandLineProteinToNucleotide</class>
 
        <!-- configuration for search tool -->
        <config>/config/blat_config.xml</config>
 
    </sequence_search_tool>
 
</sequence_search_tools>
```


Here’s the configuration for sequence search tools (allows searching
your genomic sequences). WebApollo does not implement any search
algorithms, but instead relies on different tools and resources to
handle searching (this provides much more flexible search options). This
is optional. If it’s not configured, WebApollo will not have sequence
search support. You'll need one `sequence_search_tool` element per
search tool. Let's look at the element in more detail.


``` de1
<!-- display name for the search tool -->
<key>BLAT nucleotide</key>
```


This is a string that will be used for the display name for the search
tool, in the pull down menu that provides search selection for the user.


``` de1
<!-- class for handling search -->
<class>org.bbop.apollo.tools.seq.search.blat.BlatCommandLineNucleotideToNucleotide</class>
```


Should point to the class that will handle the search request. Searching
is handled by classes that implement the
`org.bbop.apollo.tools.seq.search.SequenceSearchTool` interface. This
allows you to add support for your own favorite search tools (or
resources). We currently only have support for command line Blat, in the
following flavors:

- `org.bbop.apollo.tools.seq.search.blat.BlatCommandLineNucleotideToNucleotide`
  - Blat search for a nucleotide query against a nucleotide database
- `org.bbop.apollo.tools.seq.search.blat.BlatCommandLineProteinToNucleotide`
  - Blat search for a protein query against a nucleotide database


``` de1
<!-- configuration for search tool -->
<config>/config/blat_config.xml</config>
```


File that contains the configuration for the searching plugin chosen. If
you’re using Blat, you should not change this. If you’re using your own
plugin, you’ll want to point this to the right configuration file (which
will be dependent on your plugin). See the [Blat](#Blat) section for
details on configuring WebApollo to use Blat.


``` de1
<!-- data adapters for writing annotation data to different formats.
These will be used to dynamically generate data adapters within

    </data_adapter_group>
 
</data_adapters>
```


Here’s the configuration for data adapters (allows writing annotations
to different formats). This is optional. If it’s not configured,
WebApollo will not have data writing support. You'll need one
`<data_adapter>` element per data adapter. You can group data adapters
by placing each `<data_adapter>` inside a `<data_adapter_group>`
element. Let's look at the `<data_adapter>` element in more detail.


``` de1
<!-- display name for data adapter -->
<key>GFF3</key>
```


This is a string that will be used for the data adapter name, in the
dynamically generated data adapters list for the user.


``` de1
<!-- class for data adapter plugin -->
<class>org.bbop.apollo.web.dataadapter.gff3.Gff3DataAdapter</class>
```


Should point to the class that will handle the write request. Writing is
handled by classes that implement the
`org.bbop.apollo.web.dataadapter.DataAdapter` interface. This allows you
to add support for writing to different formats. We currently only have
support for:

- `org.bbop.apollo.web.dataadapter.gff3.Gff3DataAdapter`
  - GFF3 (see the [GFF3](#GFF3) section for details on this adapter)
- `org.bbop.apollo.web.dataadapter.chado.ChadoDataAdapter`
  - Chado (see the [Chado](#Chado) section for details on this adapter)
- `org.bbop.apollo.web.dataadapter.fasta.FastaDataAdapter`
  - FASTA (see the [FASTA](#FASTA) section for details on this adapter)


``` de1
<!-- required permission for using data adapter
 available options are: read, write, publish -->
<permission>publish</permission>
```


Required user permission for accessing this data adapter. If the user
does not have the required permission, it will not be available in the
list of data adapters. Available permissions are `read`, `write`, and
`publish`.


``` de1
<!-- configuration for data adapter -->
<config>/config/gff3_config.xml</config>
```


File that contains the configuration for the data adapter plugin chosen.


``` de1
<!-- options to be passed to data adapter -->
<options>output=file&amp;format=gzip</options>
```


Options to be passed to the data adapter. These are dependent on the
data adapter.

Next, let's look at the `<data_adapter_group>` element:


``` de1
<!-- display name for adapter group -->
<key>FASTA</key>
```


This is a string that will be used for the data adapter submenu name.

\<permission\>read\</permission\> Required user permission for accessing
this data adapter group. If the user does not have the required
permission, it will not be available in the list of data adapters.
Available permissions are `read`, `write`, and `publish`.

### <span id="Translation_tables" class="mw-headline">Translation tables</span>

WebApollo has support for alternate translation tables. For your
convenience, WebApollo comes packaged with the current NCBI translation
tables. They reside in the `config/translation_tables` directory in your
installation
(`/var/lib/tomcat7/webapps/WebApollo/config/translation_tables`).
They're all named `ncbi_#_translation_table.txt` where `#` represents
the NCBI translation table number (for example, for ciliates, you'd use
`ncbi_6_translation_table.txt`).

You can also customize your own translation table. The format is tab
delimited, with each entry containing either 2 or 3 columns. The 3rd
column is only used in the cases of start and stop codons. You only need
to put entries for codons that differ from the standard translation
table (#1). The first column has the codon triplet and the second has
the IUPAC single letter representation for the translated amino acid.
The stop codon should be represented as `*` (asterisk).


``` de1
TAA   Q
```


As mentioned previously, you'll only need the 3rd column for start and
stop codons. To denote a codon as a start codon, put in `start` in the
third column. For example, if we wanted to assign `GTG` as a start
codon, we'd enter:


``` de1
GTG   V   start
```


For stop codons, if we enter an IUPAC single letter representation for
the amino acid in the 3rd column, we're denoting that amino acid to be
used in the case of a readthrough stop codon. For example, to use
pyrrolysine, we'd enter:


``` de1
TAG   *   O
```


If you write your own customized translation table, make sure to update
the `<translation_table>` element in your configuration to your
customized file.

### <span id="Canned_comments" class="mw-headline">Canned comments</span>

You can configure a set of predefined comments that will be available
for users when adding comments through a dropdown menu. The
configuration is stored in
`/var/lib/tomcat7/webapps/WebApollo/config/canned_comments.xml`. Let’s
take a look at the configuration file.


``` de1
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
 
<canned_comments>
    <!-- one <comment> element per comment.
 it must contain either the attribute "feature_type" that defines
 the type of feature this comment will apply to or the attribute "feature_types"
 that defines a list (comma separated) of types of features this comment will
 apply to.
 types must be be in the form of "CV:term" (e.g., "sequence:gene")
 
 <comment feature_type="sequence:gene">This is a comment for sequence:gene</comment>
 or
 <comment feature_types="sequence:tRNA,sequence:ncRNA">This is a comment for both sequence:tRNA and sequence:ncRNA</comment>
 -->
</canned_comments>
```


You’ll need one `<comment>` element for each predefined comment. The
element needs to have either a `feature_type` attribute in the form of
`CV:term` that this comment applies to or a `feature_types` attribute, a
comma separated list of types this comment will apply to, where each
type is also in the form of `CV:term`. Let’s make a few comments for
feature of type `sequence:gene` and `sequence:transcript`,
`sequence:mRNA`:


``` de1
<comment feature_type="sequence:gene">This is a comment for a gene</comment>
<comment feature_type="sequence:gene">This is another comment for a gene</comment>
<comment feature_types="sequence:transcript,sequence:mRNA">This is a comment for both a transcript or mRNA</comment>
```


All [supported annotation types](#Supported_annotation_types) can be
used.

### <span id="Search_tools" class="mw-headline">Search tools</span>

As mentioned previously, WebApollo makes use of tools for sequence
searching rather than employing its own search algorithm. The only
currently supported tool is command line Blat.

#### <span id="Blat" class="mw-headline">Blat</span>

You’ll need to have Blat installed and a search database with your
genomic sequences available to make use of this feature. You can get
documentation on the Blat command line suite of tools at
<a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/blatSpec.html"
class="external text" rel="nofollow">BLAT Suite Program Specifications
and User Guide</a> and get information on setting up the tool in the
official <a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQblat.html#blat3#blat3"
class="external text" rel="nofollow">BLAT FAQ</a>. The configuration is
stored in `/var/lib/tomcat7/webapps/WebApollo/config/blat_config.xml`.
Let’s take a look at the configuration file:


``` de1
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
 
<!-- configuration file for setting up command line Blat support -->
 
<blat_config>
 
    <!-- path to Blat binary →
 <blat_bin>ENTER_PATH_TO_BLAT_BINARY</blat_bin>
 
 <!-- path to where to put temporary data -->
    <tmp_dir>ENTER_PATH_FOR_TEMPORARY_DATA</tmp_dir>
 
    <!-- path to Blat database -->
    <database>ENTER_PATH_TO_BLAT_DATABASE</database>
 
    <!-- any Blat options (directly passed to Blat) e.g., -minMatch -->
    <blat_options>ENTER_ANY_BLAT_OPTIONS</blat_options>
 
    <!-- true to remove temporary data path after search (set to false for debugging purposes) -->
    <remove_tmp_dir>true</remove_tmp_dir>
 
</blat_config>
```


Let’s look at each element with values filled in.


``` de1
<!-- path to Blat binary -->
<blat_bin>/usr/local/bin/blat</blat_bin>
```


We need to point to the location where the Blat binary resides. We've
installed Blat in `/usr/local/bin`.


``` de1
<!-- path to where to put temporary data -->
<tmp_dir>/data/webapollo/blat/tmp</tmp_dir>
```


We need to point to the location where to store temporary files to be
used in the Blat search. It can be set to whatever location you’d like.


``` de1
<!-- path to Blat database -->
<database>/data/webapollo/blat/db/genomic.2bit</database>
```


We need to point to the location of the search database to be used by
Blat. See the Blat documentation for more information on generation
search databases.


``` de1
<!-- any Blat options (directly passed to Blat) e.g., -minMatch -->
<blat_options>-minScore=100 -minIdentity=60</blat_options>
```


Here we can configure any extra options to used by Blat. These options
are passed verbatim to the program. In this example, we’re passing the
`-minScore` parameter with a minimum score of `100` and the
`-minIdentity` parameter with a value of `60` (60% identity). See the
Blat documentation for information of all available options.


``` de1
<!-- true to remove temporary data path after search (set to false for debugging purposes) -->
<remove_tmp_dir>true</remove_tmp_dir>
```


Whether to delete the temporary files generated for the BLAT search. Set
it to `false` to not delete the files after the search, which is useful
for debugging why your search may have failed or returned no results.

### <span id="Data_adapters" class="mw-headline">Data adapters</span>

#### <span id="GFF3" class="mw-headline">GFF3</span>

The GFF3 data adapter will allow exporting the current annotations as a
GFF3 file. You can get more information about the GFF3 format at
<a href="http://www.sequenceontology.org/gff3.shtml"
class="external text" rel="nofollow">The Sequence Ontology GFF3 page</a>.
The configuration is stored in
`/var/lib/tomcat7/webapps/WebApollo/config/gff3_config.xml`. Let’s take
a look at the configuration file:


``` de1
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
 
<!-- configuration file for GFF3 data adapter -->
 
<gff3_config>
 
    <!-- path to where to put generated GFF3 file.  This path is 
     relative path that will be where you deployed your 
     instance (so that it's accessible from HTTP download requests) -->
    <tmp_dir>tmp</tmp_dir>
 
    <!-- value to use in the source column (column 2) of the generated
     GFF3 file. -->
    <source>.</source>
 
    <!-- which metadata to export as an attribute - optional.
     Default is to export everything except owner, date_creation, and date_last_modified -->
    <!--
 <metadata_to_export>
     <metadata type="name" />
     <metadata type="symbol" />
     <metadata type="description" />
     <metadata type="status" />
     <metadata type="dbxrefs" />
     <metadata type="attributes" />
     <metadata type="comments" />
     <metadata type="owner" />
     <metadata type="date_creation" />
     <metadata type="date_last_modified" />
 </metadata_to_export>
 -->
 
    <!-- whether to export underlying genomic sequence - optional.
 Defaults to true -->
    <export_source_genomic_sequence>true</export_source_genomic_sequence>
 
</gff3_config>
```



``` de1
<tmp_dir>tmp</tmp_dir>
```


This is the root directory where the GFF3 files will be generated. The
actual GFF3 files will be in subdirectories that are generated to
prevent collisions from concurrent requests. This directory is relative
to `/var/lib/tomcat7/webapps/WebApollo`. This is done to allow the
generated GFF3 to be accessible from HTTP requests.


``` de1
<!-- value to use in the source column (column 2) of the generated
 GFF3 file. -->
<source>.</source>
```


This is what to put as the source (column 2) in the generated GFF3 file.
You can change the value to anything you'd like.


``` de1
<!-- which metadata to export as an attribute - optional.
 Default is to export everything except owner, date_creation, and date_last_modified -->
<metadata_to_export>
    <metadata type="name" />
    <metadata type="symbol" />
    <metadata type="description" />
    <metadata type="status" />
    <metadata type="dbxrefs" />
    <metadata type="attributes" />
    <metadata type="comments" />
    <metadata type="owner" />
    <metadata type="date_creation" />
    <metadata type="date_last_modified" />
</metadata_to_export>
```


This defines which metadata to export in the GFF3 (in column 9). This
configuration is optional. The default is to export everything except
owner, date_creation, and date_last_modified. You need to define one
`<metadata<>` element with the appropriate `type` attribute per metadata
type you want to export. Available types are:

- name
- symbol
- description
- status
- dbxrefs
- attributes
- comments
- owner
- date_creation
- date_last_modified


``` de1
<!-- whether to export underlying genomic sequence - optional.
Defaults to true -->
<export_source_genomic_sequence>true</export_source_genomic_sequence>
```


Determines whether to export the underlying genomic sequence as FASTA
attached to the GFF3 file. Set to `false` to disable it. Defaults to
`true`.

Note that the generated files will reside in that directory indefinitely
to allow users to download them. You'll need to eventually remove those
files to prevent the file system from cluttering up. There's a script
that will traverse the directory and remove any files that are older
than a provided time and cleanup directories as they become empty. It's
recommended to setup this script as a `cron` job that runs hourly to
remove any files older than an hour (should provide plenty of time for
users to download those files). The script is in
`~/WebApollo-2014-04-03/tools/cleanup/remove_temporary_files.sh`.

    $ ~/WebApollo-2014-04-03/tools/cleanup/remove_temporary_files.sh -d /var/lib/tomcat7/webapps/WebApollo/tmp -m 60

#### <span id="Chado" class="mw-headline">Chado</span>

The Chado data adapter will allow writing the current annotations to a
Chado database. You can get more information about the Chado at
<a href="../Chado" class="external text" rel="nofollow">GMOD Chado
page</a>. The configuration is stored in
`/var/lib/tomcat7/webapps/WebApollo/config/chado_config.xml`. Let’s take
a look at the configuration file:


``` de1
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
 
<!-- configuration file for Chado data adapter -->
 
<chado_config>
 
    <!-- Hibernate configuration file for accessing Chado database -->
    <hibernate_config>/config/hibernate.xml</hibernate_config>
 
</chado_config>
```


There's only one element to be configured:


``` de1
<hibernate_config>/config/hibernate.xml</hibernate_config>
```


This points to the Hibernate configuration for accessing the Chado
database. Hibernate provides an ORM (Object Relational Mapping) for
relational databases. This is used to access the Chado database. The
Hibernate configuration is stored in
`/var/lib/tomcat7/webapps/WebApollo/config/hibernate.xml`. It is quite
large (as it contains a lot of mapping resources), so let's take a look
at the parts of the configuration file that are of interest (near the
top of the file):


``` de1
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE hibernate-configuration PUBLIC
      "-//Hibernate/Hibernate Configuration DTD 3.0//EN"
      "http://hibernate.sourceforge.net/hibernate-configuration-3.0.dtd">
<hibernate-configuration>
    <session-factory name="SessionFactory">
        <property name="hibernate.connection.driver_class">org.postgresql.Driver</property>
        <property name="hibernate.connection.url">ENTER_DATABASE_CONNECTION_URL</property>
        <property name="hibernate.connection.username">ENTER_USERNAME</property>
        <property name="hibernate.connection.password">ENTER_PASSWORD</property>
 
        ...
 
    </session-factory>
</hibernate-configuration>
```


Let's look at each element:


``` de1
<property name="hibernate.connection.driver_class">org.postgresql.Driver</property>
```


The database driver for the RDBMS where the Chado database exists. It
will most likely be PostgreSQL (as it's the officially recommended RDBMS
for Chado), in which case you should leave this at its default value.


``` de1
<property name="hibernate.connection.url">jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/drupal</property>
```


JDBC URL to connect to the Chado database. It will be in the form of
`jdbc:$RDBMS://$SERVERNAME:$PORT/$DATABASE_NAME` where `$RDBMS` is the
RDBMS used for the Chado database, `$SERVERNAME` is the server's name,
`$PORT` is the database port, and `$DATABASE_NAME` is the database's
name. Let's say we're connecting to a Chado database running on
PostgreSQL on server `my_server`, port `5432` (PostgreSQL's default),
and a database name of `my_organism`, the connection URL will look as
follows: `jdbc:postgresql://my_server:5432/my_organism`.


``` de1
<property name="hibernate.connection.username">ubuntu</property>
```


User name used to connect to the database. This user should have write
privileges to the database.


``` de1
<property name="hibernate.connection.password">none</property>
```


Password for the provided user name.

#### <span id="FASTA" class="mw-headline">FASTA</span>

The FASTA data adapter will allow exporting the current annotations to a
FASTA file. The configuration is stored in
`/var/lib/tomcat7/webapps/WebApollo/config/fasta_config.xml`. Let’s take
a look at the configuration file:


``` de1
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
 
<!-- configuration file for FASTA data adapter -->
 
<fasta_config>
 
    <!-- path to where to put generated FASTA file.  This path is a
 relative path that will be where you deployed your WebApollo
 instance (so that it's accessible from HTTP download requests) -->
    <tmp_dir>tmp</tmp_dir>
 
    <!-- feature types to process when dumping FASTA sequence -->
    <feature_types>
 
        <!-- feature type to process - one element per type -->
        <feature_type>sequence:mRNA</feature_type>
 
        <feature_type>sequence:transcript</feature_type>
 
    </feature_types>
 
    <!-- which metadata to export as an attribute - optional.
 Default does not export any metadata -->
    <!--
 <metadata_to_export>
     <metadata type="name" />
     <metadata type="symbol" />
     <metadata type="description" />
     <metadata type="status" />
     <metadata type="dbxrefs" />
     <metadata type="attributes" />
     <metadata type="comments" />
     <metadata type="owner" />
     <metadata type="date_creation" />
     <metadata type="date_last_modified" />
 </metadata_to_export>
 -->
 
</fasta_config>
```



``` de1
<!-- path to where to put generated FASTA file.  This path is a
relative path that will be where you deployed your WebApollo
instance (so that it's accessible from HTTP download requests) -->
<tmp_dir>tmp</tmp_dir>
```


This is the root directory where the FASTA files will be generated. The
actual FASTA files will be in subdirectories that are generated to
prevent collisions from concurrent requests. This directory is relative
to /var/lib/tomcat7/webapps/WebApollo. This is done to allow the
generated FASTA to be accessible from HTTP requests.


``` de1
<!-- feature types to process when dumping FASTA sequence -->
<feature_types>
 
    <!-- feature type to process - one element per type -->
    <feature_type>sequence:mRNA</feature_type>
 
    <feature_type>sequence:transcript</feature_type>
 
</feature_types>
```


This defines which annotation types should be processed when exporting
the FASTA data. You'll need one `<feature_type>` element for each type
you want to have processed. Only the defined `feature_type` elements
will all be processed, so you might want to have different configuration
files for processing different types of annotations (which you can point
to in FASTA data adapter in the `config` element in `config.xml`). All
[supported annotation types](#Supported_annotation_types) can be used
for the value of `feature_type`, with the addition of `sequence:exon`.

In `config.xml`, in the `<options>` element in the `<data_adapter>`
configuration for the FASTA adapter, you'll notice that there's a
`seqType` option. You can change that value to modify which type of
sequence will be exported as FASTA. Available options are:

- peptide
  - Export the peptide sequence. This will only apply to protein coding
    transcripts and protein coding exons
- cdna
  - Export the cDNA sequence. This will only apply to transcripts and
    exons
- cds
  - Export the CDS sequence. This will only apply to protein coding
    transcripts and protein coding exons
- genomic
  - Export the genomic within the feature's boundaries. This applies to
    all feature types.


``` de1
<!-- which metadata to export as an attribute - optional.
Default does not export any metadata -->
<!--
<metadata_to_export>
 <metadata type="name" />
 <metadata type="symbol" />
 <metadata type="description" />
 <metadata type="status" />
 <metadata type="dbxrefs" />
 <metadata type="attributes" />
 <metadata type="comments" />
 <metadata type="owner" />
 <metadata type="date_creation" />
 <metadata type="date_last_modified" />
</metadata_to_export>
-->
```


Defines which metadata to export in the defline for each feature. The
default is to not output any of the listed metadata. Uncomment to turn
on this option. Note that you can remove (or comment) any `<metadata>`
elements that you're not interested in exporting.

Note that like the GFF3 adapter, the generated files will reside in that
directory indefinitely to allow users to download them. You'll need to
eventually remove those files to prevent the file system from cluttering
up. You can use the `remove_temporary_files.sh` script to handle the
cleanup. In fact, if you configure both the GFF3 and FASTA adapters to
use the same temporary directory, you'll only need to worry about
cleanup from a single location. See the [GFF3](#GFF3) section for
information about `remove_temporary_files.sh`.

## <span id="Data_generation" class="mw-headline">Data generation</span>

The steps for generating data (in particular static data) are mostly
similar to [JBrowse](../JBrowse.1 "JBrowse") data generation steps, with
some extra steps required. The scripts for data generation reside in
`/var/lib/tomcat7/webapps/WebApollo/jbrowse/bin`. Let's go into
WebApollo's JBrowse directory.

    $ cd /var/lib/tomcat7/webapps/WebApollo/jbrowse

It will make things easier if we make sure that the scripts in the `bin`
directory are executable.

    $ chmod 755 bin/*

As mentioned previously, the data resides in the `data` directory by
default. We can symlink `/data/webapollo/jbrowse` giving you a lot of
flexibility in allowing your WebApollo instance to easily point to a new
data directory.

    $ ln -sf /data/webapollo/jbrowse data

### <span id="DNA_track_setup" class="mw-headline">DNA track setup</span>

The first thing we need to do before processing our evidence is to
generate the reference sequence data to be used by JBrowse. We'll use
the `prepare-refseqs.pl` script.

    $ bin/prepare-refseqs.pl --fasta ~/sample_data/pyu_data/scf1117875582023.fa

We now have the DNA track setup. Note that you can also use a GFF3 file
containing the genomic sequence by using the `--gff` option instead of
`--fasta` and point it to the GFF3 file.

### <span id="Adding_the_WebApollo_plugin" class="mw-headline">Adding the WebApollo plugin</span>

We now need to setup the data configuration to use the WebApollo plugin.
We'll use the `add-webapollo-plugin.pl` script to do so.

    $ bin/add-webapollo-plugin.pl -i data/trackList.json

### <span id="Static_data_generation" class="mw-headline">Static data generation</span>

Generating data from GFF3 works best by having a separate GFF3 per
source type. If your GFF3 has all source types in the same file, we need
to split up the GFF3. We can use the `split_gff_by_source.pl` script in
`~/WebApollo-2014-04-03/tools/data` to do so. We'll output the split
GFF3 to some temporary directory (we'll use `~/scratch/split_gff`).

    $ mkdir -p ~/scratch/split_gff
    $ ~/WebApollo-2014-04-03/tools/data/split_gff_by_source.pl \
    -i ~/sample_data/pyu_data/scf1117875582023.gff -d ~/scratch/split_gff

If we look at the contents of `~/scratch/split_gff`, we can see we have
the following files:

    $ ls ~/scratch/split_gff
    blastn.gff  est2genome.gff  protein2genome.gff  repeatrunner.gff
    blastx.gff  maker.gff       repeatmasker.gff    snap_masked.gff

We need to process each file and create the appropriate tracks.

#### <span id="GFF3_with_gene.2Ftranscript.2Fexon.2FCDS.2Fpolypeptide_features" class="mw-headline">GFF3 with gene/transcript/exon/CDS/polypeptide features</span>

We'll start off with `maker.gff`. We need to handle that file a bit
differently than the rest of the files since the GFF represents the
features as gene, transcript, exons, and CDSs.

    $ bin/flatfile-to-json.pl --gff ~/scratch/split_gff/maker.gff \
    --arrowheadClass trellis-arrowhead --getSubfeatures \
    --subfeatureClasses '{"wholeCDS": null, "CDS":"brightgreen-80pct", "UTR": "darkgreen-60pct", "exon":"container-100pct"}' \
    --cssClass container-16px --type mRNA --trackLabel maker

Note that `brightgreen-80pct`, `darkgreen-60pct`, `container-100pct`,
`container-16px`, `gray-center-20pct` are all CSS classes defined in
WebApollo stylesheets that describe how to display their respective
features and subfeatures. WebApollo also tries to use reasonable default
CSS styles, so it is possible to omit these CSS class arguments. For
example, to accept default styles for maker.gff, the above could instead
be shortened to:

    $ bin/flatfile-to-json.pl --gff ~/scratch/split_gff/maker.gff \
    --getSubfeatures --type mRNA --trackLabel maker

See the [Customizing features](#Customizing_features) section for more
information on CSS styles. There are also many other configuration
options for flatfile-to-json.pl, see [JBrowse data
formatting](../JBrowse_Configuration_Guide#Data_Formatting "JBrowse Configuration Guide")
for more information.

#### <span id="GFF3_with_match.2Fmatch_part_features" class="mw-headline">GFF3 with match/match_part features</span>

Now we need to process the other remaining GFF3 files. The entries in
those are stored as "match/match_part", so they can all be handled in a
similar fashion.

We'll start off with `blastn` as an example.

    $ bin/flatfile-to-json.pl --gff ~/scratch/split_gff/blastn.gff \
    --arrowheadClass webapollo-arrowhead --getSubfeatures \
    --subfeatureClasses '{"match_part": "darkblue-80pct"}' \
    --cssClass container-10px --trackLabel blastn

Again, `container-10px` and `darkblue-80pct` are CSS class names that
define how to display those elements. See the [Customizing
features](#Customizing_features) section for more information.

We need to follow the same steps for the remaining GFF3 files. It can be
a bit tedious to do this for the remaining six files, so we can use a
simple Bash shell script to help us out (write the script to a file and
execute as shown below). Don't worry if the script doesn't make sense,
you can always process each file manually on the command line:

      for i in $(ls ~/scratch/split_gff/*.gff | grep -v maker); do
        j=$(basename $i)
        j=${j/.gff/}
        echo "Processing $j"
        bin/flatfile-to-json.pl --gff $i --arrowheadClass webapollo-arrowhead \
        --getSubfeatures --subfeatureClasses "{\"match_part\": \"darkblue-80pct\"}" \
        --cssClass container-10px --trackLabel $j
      done

#### <span id="Generate_searchable_name_index" class="mw-headline">Generate searchable name index</span>

Once data tracks have been created, you will need to generate a
searchable index of names using the generate-names.pl script:

    $ bin/generate-names.pl

This script creates an index of sequence names and feature names in
order to enable auto-completion in the navigation text box. This index
is required, so if you do not wish any of the feature tracks to be
indexed for auto-completion, you can instead run generate-names.pl
immediately after running prepare_refseqs.pl, but before generating
other tracks.

The script can be also rerun after any additional tracks are generated
if you wish feature names from that track to be added to the index
(using the `--incremental` option).

#### <span id="BAM_data" class="mw-headline">BAM data</span>

Now let's look how to configure BAM support. WebApollo has native
support for BAM, so no extra processing of the data is required.

First we'll copy the BAM data into the WebApollo data directory. We'll
put it in the `data/bam` directory. Keep in mind that this BAM data was
randomly generated, so there's really no biological meaning to it. We
only created it to show BAM support.

    $ mkdir data/bam
    $ cp ~/sample_data/pyu_data/*.bam* data/bam

Now we need to add the BAM track.

    $ bin/add-bam-track.pl --bam_url bam/simulated-sorted.bam \
       --label simulated_bam --key "simulated BAM"

You should now have a `simulated BAM` track available.

#### <span id="BigWig_data" class="mw-headline">BigWig data</span>

WebApollo has native support for BigWig files (.bw), so no extra
processing of the data is required.

Configuring a BigWig track is very similar to configuring a BAM track.
First we'll copy the BigWig data into the WebApollo data directory.
We'll put it in the `data/bigwig` directory. Keep in mind that this
BigWig data was generated as a coverage map derived from the randomly
generated BAM data, so like the BAM data there's really no biological
meaning to it. We only created it to show BigWig support.

    $ mkdir data/bigwig
    $ cp ~/sample_data/pyu_data/*.bw data/bigwig

Now we need to add the BigWig track.

    $ bin/add-bw-track.pl --bw_url bigwig/simulated-sorted.coverage.bw \
      --label simulated_bw --key "simulated BigWig"

You should now have a `simulated BigWig` track available.

### <span id="Customizing_different_annotation_types" class="mw-headline">Customizing different annotation types</span>

To change how the different annotation types look in the annotation
track, you'll need to update the mapping of the annotation type to the
appropriate CSS class. This data resides in `trackList.json` after
running `add-webapollo-plugin.pl`. You'll need to modify the JSON entry
whose label is `Annotations`. Of particular interest is the
`alternateClasses` element. Let's look at that default element:

    "alternateClasses": {
        "pseudogene" : {
           "className" : "light-purple-80pct",
           "renderClassName" : "gray-center-30pct"
        },
        "tRNA" : {
           "className" : "brightgreen-80pct",
           "renderClassName" : "gray-center-30pct"
        },
        "snRNA" : {
           "className" : "brightgreen-80pct",
           "renderClassName" : "gray-center-30pct"
        },
        "snoRNA" : {
           "className" : "brightgreen-80pct",
           "renderClassName" : "gray-center-30pct"
        },
        "ncRNA" : {
           "className" : "brightgreen-80pct",
           "renderClassName" : "gray-center-30pct"
        },
        "miRNA" : {
           "className" : "brightgreen-80pct",
           "renderClassName" : "gray-center-30pct"
        },
        "rRNA" : {
           "className" : "brightgreen-80pct",
           "renderClassName" : "gray-center-30pct"
        },
        "repeat_region" : {
           "className" : "magenta-80pct"
        },
        "transposable_element" : {
           "className" : "blue-ibeam",
           "renderClassName" : "blue-ibeam-render"
        }
    },

For each annotation type, you can override the default class mapping for
both `className` and `renderClassName` to use another CSS class. Check
out the [Customizing features](#Customizing_features) section for more
information on customizing the CSS classes.

### <span id="Customizing_features" class="mw-headline">Customizing features</span>

The visual appearance of biological features in WebApollo (and JBrowse)
is handled by CSS stylesheets. Every feature and subfeature is given a
default CSS "class" that matches a default CSS style in a CSS
stylesheet. These styles are are defined in
`/var/lib/tomcat7/webapps/WebApollo/jbrowse/track_styles.css` and
`/var/lib/tomcat7/webapps/WebApollo/jbrowse/plugins/WebApollo/css/webapollo_track_styles.css`.
Additional styles are also defined in these files, and can be used by
explicitly specifying them in the -cssClass, --subfeatureClasses,
--renderClassname, or --arrowheadClass parameters to
flatfile-to-json.pl. See example
[above](#GFF3_with_gene.2Ftranscript.2Fexon.2FCDS.2Fpolypeptide_features)

WebApollo differs from JBrowse in some of it's styling, largely in order
to help with feature selection, edge-matching, and dragging. WebApollo
by default uses invisible container elements (with style class names
like "container-16px") for features that have children, so that the
children are fully contained within the parent feature. This is paired
with another styled element that gets rendered *within* the feature but
underneath the subfeatures, and is specified by the --renderClassname
argument to flatfile-to-json.pl. Exons are also by default treated as
special invisible containers, which hold styled elements for UTRs and
CDS.

It is relatively easy to add other stylesheets that have custom style
classes that can be used as parameters to flatfile-to-json.pl. Examples
are available in
`/var/lib/tomcat7/webapps/WebApollo/jbrowse/plugins/WebApollo/css/custom_track_styles.css`.

You need to tell WebApollo where to find these styles. Additional CSS
files can be specified in the trackList.json file that is created in the
data directory during static data generation, by adding a "css" property
to the JSON data:

       "css" : "plugins/WebApollo/css/custom_track_styles.css" 

Then these new styles can be used as arguments to flatfile-to-json.pl,
for example:

    bin/flatfile-to-json.pl --gff /split_gff/maker.gff 
    --getSubfeatures --type mRNA --trackLabel maker --webApollo 
    --subfeatureClasses '{"CDS":"darkorange-80pct", "UTR": "darkorange-60pct"}' 

## <span id="Restart_WebApollo" class="mw-headline">Restart WebApollo</span>

It is generally a good idea to restart WebApollo (or Tomcat) after
making any configuration modifications. Note that you don't need to
restart the application if you've only modified data.

    $ sudo service tomcat7 restart

## <span id="Bulk_loading_annotations_to_the_user_annotation_track" class="mw-headline">Bulk loading annotations to the user annotation track</span>

### <span id="GFF3_2" class="mw-headline">GFF3</span>

You can use the
`~/WebApollo-2014-04-03/tools/data/add_transcripts_from_gff3_to_annotations.pl`
script to bulk load GFF3 files with transcripts to the user annotation
track. Let's say we want to load our `maker.gff` transcripts.

    $ ~/WebApollo-2014-04-03/tools/data/add_transcripts_from_gff3_to_annotations.pl \
    -U localhost/WebApollo -u web_apollo_admin -p web_apollo_admin \
    -i ~/scratch/split_gff/maker.gff

The default options should be handle GFF3 most files that contain genes,
transcripts, and exons.

You can still use this script even if the file you're loading does not
contain transcripts and exons. Let's say we want to load `match` and
`match_part` features as transcripts and exons respectively. We'll use
the `blastn.gff` file as an example.

    $ ~/WebApollo-2014-04-03/tools/data/add_transcripts_from_gff3_to_annotations.pl \
    -U localhost/WebApollo -u web_apollo_admin -p web_apollo_admin \
    -i ~/scratch/split_gff/blastn.gff -t match -e match_part

Look at the script's help (`-h`) for all available options.

## <span id="Testing_out_your_installation" class="mw-headline">Testing out your installation</span>

Let's test out our installation. Point your browser to
`http://ec2-##-##-##-##.compute-1.amazonaws.com/WebApollo`  
(e.g., `http://ec2-184-73-92-243.compute-1.amazonaws.com/WebApollo`).

We only see one reference sequence to annotate since we're only working
with one contig. Click on the ` scf1117875582023` link.

Congratulations, you're done configuring WebApollo!

Now have fun annotating!!!
