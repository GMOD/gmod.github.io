Jump to: [navigation](#mw-navigation), [search](#p-search)


The [GMOD](Main_Page "Main Page") Logo Program connects graphic design
programs at colleges and universities with GMOD users that would like a
new logo. This is usually done as part of a course, with each student or
team of students being assigned to a different client (a GMOD user) The
students then work with the client to produce a high-quality logo for
that client.

Different design programs will be involved at different times during the
life of this program, and the specific details of the program will vary
depending on the design program that is currently involved. However,
there are some general guidelines that apply to all programs.

[Apollo](Apollo.1 "Apollo")'s new logo, designed by [Audra
Radke](Spring_2010_Logo_Program#Linn-Benton_Community_College "Spring 2010 Logo Program"),
during the [Spring 2010 Logo
Program](Spring_2010_Logo_Program "Spring 2010 Logo Program").




1.  You must be a non-profit organization.
2.  You are willing to meet virtually (phone, Skype, AIM, IChat, etc.)
    with the students on a regular basis to first explain what your
    database/web site/organism is about and what makes it unique, and
    then to provide feedback and guidance on the student designs as they
    progress.
3.  You have time to work with students during the time window when the
    course is working on this.
4.  You provide the teaching institution with feedback / student
    evaluation that is requested.
5.  If you use the new design, you give credit somewhere on your web
    site (that is reachable by search engines), to the student(s) who
    created it and to the institution they were attending.
6.  Before meeting with the student you should give some thought to what
    your requirements are. Does the logo need to look good in black and
    white? Does it need to appear in a favicon?

*If you already have a design in mind and you just want it polished,
then this program is **not** for you.* The goals of the program are two
fold. First to provide you with a logo, and second to provide students
with design experience. If you already have a design the students won't
get that experience.

Read](Spring_2010_Logo_Program#Linn-Benton_Community_College "Spring 2010 Logo Program"),

Program](Spring_2010_Logo_Program "Spring 2010 Logo Program").




1.  You are willing to meet virtually (phone, Skype, IChat, AIM, *etc.*)
    with your client on a regular basis so that you can understand their
    requirements, and what makes their web site/database/organism
    unique, interesting and useful. This may mean understanding some of
    the biology behind the site.
2.  You make any appointments that you set up.

Periodically, the [GMOD Help Desk](GMOD_Help_Desk "GMOD Help Desk") will
send out a call for participation in the GMOD Logo Program. The Help
Desk will then compile a list of interested users from which the Help
Desk and the design instructors will select a subset to assign to
students in the current course. Students and GMOD users will then be
notified of their pairings, and students will contact users to set up
meeting times.

At the end of the design period, the students will present their clients
with the logos in several different agreed upon formats and resolutions,
including the source files (Photoshop, etc.). Clients are free to adopt
the logos or not.

During the course, the Help Desk will be available to meet with the
class, either virtually or in person, at the start and end of the
project. The Help Desk can also help coordinate interactions between
students and researchers, if needed.
