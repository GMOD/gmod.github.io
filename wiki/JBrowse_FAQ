# <span id="Setup" class="mw-headline">Setup</span>

## <span id="How_do_I_get_started_with_installing_JBrowse.3F" class="mw-headline">How do I get started with installing JBrowse?</span>

To setup jbrowse on your server, the basic idea is to download the zip
file, drop the files in a folder on a web server, and run the setup.sh
script.

You can do this for example by

- downloading the zip file from jbrowse.org, e.g.
  <a href="https://jbrowse.org/releases/JBrowse-1.12.1.zip"
  class="external free"
  rel="nofollow">https://jbrowse.org/releases/JBrowse-1.12.1.zip</a>
- unzip this file into your web server directory like /var/www/html or
  similar
- make this directory "owned" by you e.g. \`sudo chown -R myusername
  /var/www/html/jbrowse\` (not strictly necessary)
- cd into /var/www/html/jbrowse and run the setup.sh script e.g.
  \`./setup.sh\`

  
Then you should be ready to go. Note that as long as setup.sh completes
the "Installing Perl pre-requisites" phase of setup.sh you should be
good to go (the other steps are not strictly needed)

Now open up your website e.g.
<a href="http://localhost/jbrowse" class="external free"
rel="nofollow">http://localhost/jbrowse</a> and you'll already see that
is is "setup" and you can see
<a href="http://localhost/jbrowse/?data=sample_data/json/volvox"
class="external free"
rel="nofollow">http://localhost/jbrowse/?data=sample_data/json/volvox</a>
has example data

Then you can simply run a small script to get your own genome loaded.
For example, while you are in /var/www/html/jbrowse folder, then run

       bin/prepare-refseqs.pl --fasta your_genome.fa

This will create a folder named "data", and then visiting
<a href="http://localhost/jbrowse/" class="external free"
rel="nofollow">http://localhost/jbrowse/</a> will automatically load
this "data" folder and youll see your genome.

Alternatively: you can try the JBrowse Docker container for a
containerized deployment, or the JBrowse Desktop program to run without
a web server (similar to IGV)

## <span id="How_do_I_load_my_genome_as_a_FASTA_file.3F" class="mw-headline">How do I load my genome as a FASTA file?</span>

If you have JBrowse installed to your web folder and have run setup.sh,
then you can download a FASTA file for your genome and run

    bin/prepare-refseqs.pl --fasta yourfile.fasta

This will setup a "data" subfolder inside your jbrowse subdirectory with
your genome prepared to view. You can investigate data/trackList.json
and other files in this "data" folder to see what it generated.

Then just open up
"<a href="http://yourserver.com/jbrowse" class="external free"
rel="nofollow">http://yourserver.com/jbrowse</a>" and it should be
visible with the reference sequence as a track. By default, visiting
"<a href="http://yourserver.com/jbrowse" class="external free"
rel="nofollow">http://yourserver.com/jbrowse</a>" will read files from
that generated "data" folder. Other configurations are possible, but
this is the easiest one.

  

## <span id="How_do_I_setup_a_GFF_track.3F" class="mw-headline">How do I setup a GFF track?</span>

The most common feature track to use is a GFF file

Using flatfile-to-json.pl is the easiest and most optimal way to load a
GFF file for jbrowse

You can run

    bin/flatfile-to-json.pl --gff myfile.gff --trackLabel trackLabel

Refresh your browser and your GFF file should be visible as a track. You
may also experiment with adding --trackType CanvasFeatures, which is a
newer track type that is more flexible to configure, or --type mRNA to
only load mRNA features from the GFF, or other parameters that are
listed in flatfile-to-json.pl --help.

  

## <span id="How_do_I_set_up_a_BAM_file.3F" class="mw-headline">How do I set up a BAM file?</span>

When you set up a BAM file in jbrowse, the best way to do it is as
follows

1.  Put the BAM file and the BAM index (.bai) in your data directory
    (e.g. you downloaded jbrowse, and your did prepare-refseqs.pl, which
    created a data subfolder. Put your BAM file in there)
2.  Then use add-bam-track.pl like this: add-bam-track.pl --label mybam
    --bam_url mybam.bam --in data/trackList.json
3.  This will only create a simple section of configuration in your data
    directory's trackList.json for the BAM file that will look like

<!-- -->

         {
            "storeClass" : "JBrowse/Store/SeqFeature/BAM",
            "urlTemplate" : "mybam.bam",
            "label" : "mybam",
            "type" : "JBrowse/View/Track/Alignments2",
            "key" : "mybam"
         }

This basically just instructs JBrowse to fetch "mybam.bam" using the
class that understands BAM data, "JBrowse/Store/SeqFeature/BAM", and
display it with the "Alignments2" tracktype. If this does not work
please post to github or gmod-ajax@lists.sourceforge.net

Other notes

- Don't use bam-to-json.pl, it is old and converting your probably
  humongous next-gen-sequencing BAM into text json is unwieldy
- Your bam index should just be named the same as your BAM with .bai on
  the end
- The add-bam-track.pl does NOT copy the bam to your data directory for
  you, you put it there yourself, and specify the --bam_url
  appropriately
- baiUrlTemplate is unnecessary if your bai file is just your bam file
  with .bai added onto the end, in that case it is found automatically

You can also add your config into a tracks.conf file instead of the
trackList.json file, but you use a different format, for example

    [tracks.mybam]
    type=Alignments2
    urlTemplate=mybam.bam

  
This is functionally equivalent to the trackList.json entry above

## <span id="How_do_I_set_up_a_BigWig_file.3F" class="mw-headline">How do I set up a BigWig file?</span>

When you set up a BigWig file in jbrowse, the best way to do it is as
follows

1.  Put the BigWig file in your data directory and run add-bw-track.pl,
    so if you have data/file.bw, run the command \`add-bw-track.pl
    --label mybw --bam_url file.bw\`
2.  This will update your trackList.json to have something like

<!-- -->

        {
           "storeClass" : "JBrowse/Store/SeqFeature/BigWig",
           "urlTemplate" : "file.bw",
           "label" : "mybw",
           "type" : "JBrowse/View/Track/Wiggle/Density",
           "key" : "mybw"
        }

You could also add the --plot argument to add-bw-track.pl to use the
XYPlot version of the bigwig track.

Alternatively, you can manually add that snippet into trackList.json, or
add this alternative track conf form into your tracks.conf file

    [tracks.mybw]
    storeClass=JBrowse/Store/SeqFeature/BigWig
    urlTemplate=file.bw
    type=JBrowse/View/Track/Wiggle/Density

  
Notes:

- It is discouraged to use bin/wig-to-json.pl, it is a legacy script
  that converts a wiggle file into a series of pictures using libpng for
  viewing in jbrowse. The direct ability to access bigwig files is much
  better, faster, and does not require any file conversions
- The urlTemplate is a path relative to your data directory, so if your
  file is in your data directory, it only needs to be the filename of
  the bigwig.

## <span id="How_do_I_set_up_a_VCF_file.3F" class="mw-headline">How do I set up a VCF file?</span>

This is where the training wheels come off

There is no add-vcf-track.pl, so you have to edit trackList.json
yourself

First bgzip and tabix your vcf file

        bgzip myfile.vcf
        tabix -p vcf myfile.vcf.gz

If your VCF isn't sorted for any reason, just use the GNU sort utility
to sort it by chromosome and coordinate or get vcf-sort from vcftools

Now that your VCF is indexed, follow these steps

1.  Put the myfile.vcf.gz and myfile.vcf.gz.tbi in your data directory
2.  Edit data/trackList.json
3.  Put the following in there:

<!-- -->

        {
           "label": "mytrack",
           "urlTemplate": "myfile.vcf.gz",
           "storeClass": "JBrowse/Store/SeqFeature/VCFTabix", 
           "type": "CanvasVariants"
        }

That isn't too bad right? All that add-bam-track.pl does is automate
that for your similarly for BAMs, so now that you have edited the config
file by hand you are ready to take on the world!

Note you could also add your track to tracks.conf

    [tracks.mytrack]
    urlTemplate=myfile.vcf.gz
    storeClass=JBrowse/Store/SeqFeature/VCFTabix
    type=CanvasVariants

Both of these configurations represent the same track.

  

## <span id="How_do_I_get_IndexedFasta_track_to_work_in_JBrowse" class="mw-headline">How do I get IndexedFasta track to work in JBrowse</span>

A short trackList.json with an IndexedFasta reference sequence track
would look like this

    {
       "tracks" : [
          {
             "label" : "refseqs",
             "key": "Reference sequence",
             "storeClass" : "JBrowse/Store/SeqFeature/IndexedFasta",
             "urlTemplate" : "SOAPdenovo-genome.fa",
             "useAsRefSeqStore" : true,
             "type" : "Sequence"
          }
       ],
       "refSeqs" : "SOAPdenovo-genome.fa.fai"
    }

You can see from this that a couple things are needed

- useAsRefSeqStore set to true
- making label: refseqs is important when the storeClass is not the
  normal SequenceChunks class
- the refSeqs attribute refers to the FASTA index file (normally it
  points to the refSeqs.json file)

With this setup, you do not need to have run prepare-refseqs.pl on a
FASTA file. Instead you can simply use the "samtools faidx" program to
index your fasta file in a data directory, and set trackList.json up in
this format.

# <span id="General_information" class="mw-headline">General information</span>

## <span id="What_webserver_is_needed_for_JBrowse" class="mw-headline">What webserver is needed for JBrowse</span>

Most established HTTP servers such as Apache or nginx can work. You can
just unpack JBrowse into your http web directory (/var/www/html, or
htdocs, or similar) and follow the setup instructions
<a href="http://jbrowse.org/code/JBrowse-1.12.1/docs/tutorial/"
class="external free"
rel="nofollow">http://jbrowse.org/code/JBrowse-1.12.1/docs/tutorial/</a>.

Other configuration about your server will depend on your needs, but
generally no special setup is needed for the http server, and there is
no "server side" code used by JBrowse (cgi, php, etc).

  
Note: servers like "SimpleHTTPServer" from Python or "http-server" from
NPM are generally not full featured enough to run all JBrowse features
correctly (SimpleHTTPServer does not support Range queries, and
http-server interprets tabix files incorrectly). RangeHTTPServer does
pass the test suite for jbrowse though, so it should work for tests
<a href="https://github.com/danvk/RangeHTTPServer" class="external free"
rel="nofollow">https://github.com/danvk/RangeHTTPServer</a> (but not for
compressed json files).

  
Also note: sometimes, people will download JBrowse and double click the
html file and open up file:///c/myfolder/jbrowse/index.html in the
webbrowser, however, running JBrowse like this is not recommended. This
may appear to work for some limited cases but will fail on many others.
You can use JBrowse Desktop if you want to use jbrowse locally without a
webserver.

  
Since 1.12.4: The JBrowse "jb_run" script in 1.12.4 can be used to run
JBrowse. It uses a custom express.js server tailored to serve all
content headers directly.

## <span id="What_is_the_difference_between_JBrowse-1.12.1.zip_and_JBrowse-1.12.1-dev.zip.3F" class="mw-headline">What is the difference between JBrowse-1.12.1.zip and JBrowse-1.12.1-dev.zip?</span>

Ignoring version numbers here, the difference is that one is a "release"
version and one is a "development" version. If you are going to be
modifying source code of JBrowse's codebase, you probably want the
development version.

  
The "release" version goes through a build step with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minification_(programming)"
class="external text" rel="nofollow">minification</a> so that loading
the page takes less bandwidth. Different parts of the code go into
different "layers", but the main layer that includes most JBrowse source
code and JBrowse libraries goes into src/dojo/dojo.js

  
The "development" version does not go through minification, and so it is
amenable to editing the source code. You can also use a github clone for
developing source code modifications. See the next section for running
from a github clone
[\#How_do_I_run_the_code_using_the_github_clone](#How_do_I_run_the_code_using_the_github_clone)

## <span id="How_do_I_run_the_code_using_the_github_clone" class="mw-headline">How do I run the code using the github clone</span>

Running code off github is fairly straightforward, and you can actually
run it on your webserver without any build steps

  

     git clone https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse
     cd jbrowse
     ./setup.sh

Then move that directory into your web server root and you are ready to
go.

Note: If you want to make your own custom build you can use

  

    make -f build/Makefile release

  
Also also note: post 1.13.0 releases of JBrowse will automatically
create a minified custom build when you run ./setup.sh if you have a
-dev release or a github clone.

## <span id="What_are_the_different_config_file_formats.3F" class="mw-headline">What are the different config file formats?</span>

JBrowse uses both json and ".conf" files for configuration (the .conf is
a custom format that is parsed on the client side), and both file types
can contain the same types of information

Examples of JSON format

- trackList.json
- jbrowse_conf.json

Examples of conf format

- tracks.conf
- jbrowse.conf

If you wonder why you would use the .conf format, some benefits include:
easy to edit, easy to append to with text file tools, can define
multi-line functions (JSON doesn't allow newlines, so callbacks are
specified on a single line).

All the config files are combined using a system of "includes" at
runtime. The "order" behind loading all the config files is something
like this:

1.  The index.html initializes a global Browser object, and the
    paramaters to the constructor are used as the start of the config
2.  The Browser class "includes"  both jbrowse_config.json and
    jbrowse.conf using defaultConfig
3.  The jbrowse.conf by default includes both {dataRoot}/trackList.json
    and {dataRoot}/tracks.conf, which resolves to whatever data
    directory is currently being used
4.  The trackList.json or tracks.conf files can themselves include other
    files, such as a "functions.conf" file

## <span id="What_type_of_coordinate_system_does_JBrowse_use" class="mw-headline">What type of coordinate system does JBrowse use</span>

Internally it uses 0-based coordinates

When you view the data (like in the view details popups, and in their
position on the browser) it is 1-based.

The functions like feature.get('start') would return 0-based.

## <span id="What_is_the_difference_between_CanvasFeatures_and_HTMLFeatures.3F" class="mw-headline">What is the difference between CanvasFeatures and HTMLFeatures?</span>

There are a lot of differences!

- CanvasFeatures are newer.
- CanvasFeatures can support Gene glyphs, i.e., a gene with multiple
  transcripts are grouped together on the screen. In HTMLFeatures, you
  have to load at the "transcript" level, so this loses the gene level
  info (if you do try to load the --type gene, it will just load "gene
  spans", but then it doesn't display the transcript subfeatures. You
  have to use --type mRNA or similar with HTMLFeatures to see the
  transcripts!).
- CanvasFeatures are faster if your have a lot of data.
- They have different configuration functions. All the "style" methods
  on CanvasFeatures can be callback functions, so you can have a dynamic
  callback for the feature color, label, etc. The "glyph" can also be a
  callback, so you can make a function to change to a box or diamond
  glyph depending on feature attributes.
- CanvasFeatures have better mouseovers. The HTMLFeatures mouseovers use
  the HTML title attribute which can only display plain text. On
  CanvasFeatures tracks, the mouseover it is a real tooltip that you can
  embed arbitrary HTML inside of.

## <span id="What_is_a_glyph.3F" class="mw-headline">What is a glyph?</span>

Glyphs are a "unit" of drawing in a CanvasFeatures track. The glyph is
just code that is responsible for drawing a feature on the screen.

  

## <span id="What_does_generate-names.pl_do.3F" class="mw-headline">What does generate-names.pl do?</span>

Generate-names.pl will create a "search index" on, by default, the
"names, IDs, and Alias" fields for tracks loaded with
flatfile-to-json.pl or biodb-to-json.pl. It will not try to index ids
from BAM files or bigwigs, but it does index names from VCF files too.

You can select specific tracks that you want to index with --tracks
arguments to generate-names.pl. You can disable "autocomplete" by
setting --completetionLimit 0 on generate-names.pl. You can "update"
your search index by using --incremental

Also note: you can index additional fields of a GFF file with
generate-names.pl by specifying the --nameAttributes flag to
flatfile-to-json.pl. E.g. flatfile-to-json.pl --nameAttributes
"my_custom_field,name,id". The default value for this flag is
"name,alias,id". Note that the flag is passed to flatfile-to-json.pl and
then these values are automatically indexed by generate-names.pl later.

## <span id="What_is_the_.22label.22_in_trackList.json_and_what_is_the_key.3F" class="mw-headline">What is the "label" in trackList.json and what is the key?</span>

The track "label" is more like the track "identifier", it should be
unique! The key is actually more like the name that is displayed for the
track. It might sound counter intuitive to have label and key this way.
Key is not a required attribute, but label is. The label can be
specified by --trackLabel on command line tools. The key can be
specified by --key.

  

## <span id="How_do_I_search_for_a_feature_in_JBrowse" class="mw-headline">How do I search for a feature in JBrowse</span>

Some people don't know this, but the box that shows your current
location, e.g. "chr10:1..1000 (1.0 Kb)" is also a search box! You can
search for things that generate-names.pl indexed here.

Also, the search index can be used to "link" to features, for example,
if you construct a link such as
<a href="http://localhost/jbrowse/?loc=GENE1234" class="external free"
rel="nofollow">http://localhost/jbrowse/?loc=GENE1234</a>

Then the search index will resolve the location of that gene and jump to
it automatically.

## <span id="How_do_I_get_full_text_descriptions_to_be_searched.3F" class="mw-headline">How do I get full text descriptions to be searched?</span>

Try out <a href="https://github.com/cmdcolin/jbrowse_elasticsearch"
class="external text" rel="nofollow">jbrowse_elasticsearch</a>, it is
still experimental but it allows this. Or, implement your own JBrowse
REST names API. The default generate-names.pl is not built for searching
full text descriptions.

  

## <span id="How_do_I_set_up_multiple_genomes_in_a_single_jbrowse_instance.3F" class="mw-headline">How do I set up multiple genomes in a single jbrowse instance?</span>

By default, the scripts will output to a subdirectory called "data" in
the jbrowse folder

You can control that output with most scripts using the --out parameter.
This enables you to have "multiple data directories".

Once the data directories are ready then use the URL bar to select which
data directory to use with ?data=my_data_dir e.g.

<a href="http://mysite.org/jbrowse/?data=data1" class="external free"
rel="nofollow">http://mysite.org/jbrowse/?data=data1</a>
<a href="http://mysite.org/jbrowse/?data=data2" class="external free"
rel="nofollow">http://mysite.org/jbrowse/?data=data2</a>

Note that with
<a href="http://genomearchitect.org" class="external text"
rel="nofollow">Apollo</a>, you can output the data directories to some
given directory and add the directories via the user interface.

You can also setup the "dataset selector" see [\#What is the dataset
selector](#What_is_the_dataset_selector) and
[JBrowse_Configuration_Guide#Dataset_Selector](JBrowse_Configuration_Guide#Dataset_Selector "JBrowse Configuration Guide")

## <span id="What_is_the_dataset_selector" class="mw-headline">What is the dataset selector</span>

The dataset selector is a dropdown that can list all the genomes that
are in your jbrowse instance

To configure the dataset selector, set a dataset_id inside your
trackList.json or tracks.conf on your data directory, and then in
jbrowse.conf, add a list of all your datasets with the dataset_ids that
you listed in the genome's data directory.

See <a href="JBrowse_Configuration_Guide#Dataset_Selector"
class="external free"
rel="nofollow">http://gmod.org/wiki/JBrowse_Configuration_Guide#Dataset_Selector</a>

  

## <span id="How_do_I_change_the_name_that_is_displayed_on_my_features" class="mw-headline">How do I change the name that is displayed on my features</span>

If you don't like the names in the "Name" or "ID" column of your GFF,
and you instead want to use some other field as the name to be
displayed, then you can add this to your trackList.json

`"style": {"label": "my_custom_field"}`

Note: you can also index "my_custom_field" with generate-names.pl too by
supplying my_custom_field to the --nameAttributes argument from
flatfile-to-json.pl. After loading it from flatfile-to-json.pl in that
manner, it will be indexed by generate-names.pl.

Also note: you can make the description a custom field too in a similar
way

`"style": {"description": "my_custom_description_field"}`

# <span id="Customization" class="mw-headline">Customization</span>

## <span id="How_do_I_customize_feature_colors_.28with_CanvasFeatures.29" class="mw-headline">How do I customize feature colors (with CanvasFeatures)</span>

In CanvasFeatures, this is done with the style-\>color parameter. The
style-\>color parameter can be a function, so for example, if you have a
track like this in trackList.json

    {
       "label": "test",
       "type": "CanvasFeatures",
       "storeClass": "JBrowse/Store/SeqFeature/NCList",
       "style" : {
          "className" : "feature"
       }
    }

Then you can add a color like this

    {
       "label": "test",
       "type": "CanvasFeatures",
       "storeClass": "JBrowse/Store/SeqFeature/NCList",
       "style": {
           "color": "function(feature) { return 'red'; }",
           "className": "feature"
        }
    }

This will make your features red. You can also hardcode a color instead
of a callback

        "style": {
           "color": "red"
        }

  
It can be dynamic too though

        "style": {
           "color": "function(feature) { return feature.get('score')>50 ?'blue':'red'; }"
        }

The color can be a name or rgb(...) or hsl(...). rgba works too

  
Note: if you get a very complex function, consider putting it in a
separate functions.conf file and include it, see config guide "Including
external functions in trackList.json"

Note: with HTMLFeatures, it is similar, but you have to use
hooks-\>modify instead of style-\>color.

Also note: you cannot create the functions via the UI in "Edit config".
You have to specify the callback functions via the config files
themselves.

## <span id="How_do_I_add_a_legend_to_the_track_in_the_.22About_this_track.22_dialog.3F" class="mw-headline">How do I add a legend to the track in the "About this track" dialog?</span>

You can add custom info to the "About this track" dialog boxes by
specifying metadata for the track in trackList.json, e.g.

    "metadata": {"legend": "Red means this, green means that"}

This will create a box called "legend" inside the "About this track"
box.

All the "metadata" fields are added to the "About this track" dialog
box, and it can also support HTML, e.g

    "metadata": {"randominfo": "<p style='color:green'>Green text</p>", "otherrandominfo": "<p style='color:red'>Red text</p>"} 

You can also use the fmtDetailMeta and fmtFieldMeta callback functions
to change pre-existing values <a
href="JBrowse_Configuration_Guide#Additional_customizations_to_the_pop-up_boxes"
class="external free"
rel="nofollow">http://gmod.org/wiki/JBrowse_Configuration_Guide#Additional_customizations_to_the_pop-up_boxes</a>

## <span id="How_do_I_customize_the_dialog_boxes_for_the_features.3F" class="mw-headline">How do I customize the dialog boxes for the features?</span>

There are many ways to do so.

1.  To customize the default 'View details' type popups, you can
    override fields by adding a function to your track config like
    fmtDetailValue_Name: "function(value, feature) { return value + ' is
    the original name'; }"
2.  To make a different custom action for a dialog, make
    onClick-\>action a javascript callback and make it popup your own
    custom dialog box, made using dijit or any other javascript type
    language. The function would have the format function(clickEvent)
    but you can access feature information from this.feature inside the
    callback
3.  Set action: "newWindow" and url:
    "<a href="http://google.com/?q=%7Bname%7D" class="external free"
    rel="nofollow">http://google.com/?q={name}</a>" can redirect to
    search google for the feature's name (note: the {name} is a template
    parameter that is automatically filled out when a feature is
    clicked)
4.  Set action: "iframeDialog" and url:
    "<a href="http://google.com?q=%7Bname%7D" class="external free"
    rel="nofollow">http://google.com?q={name}</a>"
5.  Set onClick-\>action to contentDialog and then set onClick-\>content
    to a string or a functioning returning a string or a "promise". A
    promise can come from calling dojo.xhrGet or similar so it can
    retrieve dynamic content. The function would have the parameters
    function(track, feature)

  
Those are just a couple examples

More straightforwardly, basically any field that exists for the feature
(e.g. all the things in column 9 for a GFF) will be added to the default
"View details" boxes, so it you add more details to the GFF3 column 9,
then your popups will have more information.

## <span id="How_do_I_customize_the_main_menu_bar" class="mw-headline">How do I customize the main menu bar</span>

Typically this is done using a plugin. You can make your plugin add new
menu items. See the RegexSequenceSearch plugin for an example <a

class="external free"
rel="nofollow">https://github.com/GMOD/jbrowse/blob/master/plugins/RegexSequenceSearch/js/main.js#L23-L30</a>

You can also create a new "menu" i.e. (default says file, view, help)
and you can extend it to use (file, view, tools, help) or similar. The
GMOD/Apollo codebase does this <a

## <span id="How_do_I_customize_the_right-click_menus_on_features" class="mw-headline">How do I customize the right-click menus on features</span>

You can edit the menuTemplate parameters on the trackList.json.

Note: when you add 1 method to menuTemplate, it overwrites 1 of the
default elements in the default right-click menu. This is sort of a bug.
If you want to "add" your method to the list, then create a "blank"
menuTemplate items for the View details, etc. See
[JBrowse_Configuration_Guide#Customizing_Right-click_Context_Menus](JBrowse_Configuration_Guide#Customizing_Right-click_Context_Menus "JBrowse Configuration Guide")
for more details.

  

## <span id="How_do_I_access_data_about_my_features_in_my_callback_or_plugin" class="mw-headline">How do I access data about my features in my callback or plugin</span>

Each feature is based on what is called a feature Model. The
JBrowse/Model/SimpleFeature is an example of this, and it allows you to
call feature.get('variable_of_interest') on many different variables

  
Common types of requests

- feature.get('subfeatures') - to get all subfeatures of a feature.
- feature.get('parent') - for the parent of a feature
- feature.get('id') - for the ID
- feature.get('name') - for the name
- feature.get('my_gff_field') - to get any given field from your GFF3
  column 9
- feature.get('genotypes') - to get the genotypes of a VCF feature, it
  returns a complex object that you can inspect. See
  "variantIsHeterozygous" in the jbrowse configuration guide for an
  example of parsing the genotype
- feature.get('start') - to get start position
- feature.get('end') - to get end position
- feature.get('seq_id') - to get the chromosome name
- feature.get('seq') - to get the sequence, only works on BAM data since
  it includes sequence data in data file. In general, you must use
  getReferenceSequence over a region to get a feature's sequence

  
Note that if you have multiple values for a value in column 9 (specified
by comma separated values), then feature.get('your_value') will return
an array (except for for Note which turns into Note, Note2, Note3, etc)

For reference JBrowse/Model/SimpleFeature is a widely used feature
class. The BAM features for example use a different model because they
must be smaller and quicker to operate at speed (they are called Lazy
features, so not all their info is evaluated unless it is needed
on-demand). BAM features also have things like feature.get('seq'), to
get the sequence of the alignments, but normal features like genes do
not have feature.get('seq')

## <span id="How_to_get_default_tracks_to_display_every_time_a_user_opens_the_browser.3F" class="mw-headline">How to get default tracks to display every time a user opens the browser?</span>

There are several config variables which you can define in any of your
config files (trackList.json for example can have config items like
this, just put it outside of the track section of tracklist.json, or
under a \[general\] section of tracks.conf) as a comma separated list of
track labels

- alwaysOnTracks: Track always come up
- forceTracks: Overridden by URL bar
- defaultTracks: Overridden by URL bar and cookies

## <span id="How_can_I_embed_JBrowse_on_a_page" class="mw-headline">How can I embed JBrowse on a page</span>

The easiest way to "embed jbrowse" on another page would be to use an
iframe to link to the jbrowse instance of choice e.g.
<a href="JBrowse_Configuration_Guide#Embedded_mode"
class="external free"
rel="nofollow">http://gmod.org/wiki/JBrowse_Configuration_Guide#Embedded_mode</a>

Note that it is also possible in theory (and sometimes in practice) to
embed JBrowse without an iframe. For example, you can take the
index.html of JBrowse and customize it for your purposes. You can for
example change the GenomeBrowser div to not have 100% width and height,
and instead make it have width 1000px and height 800px for example and
put it in a specific part of your webpage.

The problem with embedding without iframe is typically that you can
easily run into issues with "CSS collisions" where the CSS from your
specific page collides with jbrowse elements, of CSS from jbrowse
elements collides with your outside page.

  

## <span id="Can_I_change_the_color_of_bases_in_the_Sequence.2FAlignments2.2FSNPCoverage_tracks.3F" class="mw-headline">Can I change the color of bases in the Sequence/Alignments2/SNPCoverage tracks?</span>

Yes. It is sort of a "hidden setting", but you can actually change
colors on the Sequence/Alignments2/SNPCoverage track using CSS

See css/sequence.css:

    /* colors for bases must be specified as hex or rgb/hsl strings, no named colors such as 'red' */
    .base_n {
        background-color: #C6C6C6;
    }
    .base_a {
        background-color: #00BF00;
    }
    .base_c {
        background-color: #4747ff;
    }
    .base_t {
        background-color: #f00;
    }
    .base_g {
        background-color: #d5bb04;
    }
    .base_reference {
        background-color: #a33;
    }
    .base_deletion {
        background-color: #999;
    }

  

If you change those, it will be reflected in your
Sequence/Alignments2/SNPCoverage track.

The .base_reference is the background grey of the SNPCoverage plot, and
if you actually add to the list and make .base_skip you can make the
intron grey change color SNPCoverage.

  

## <span id="How_can_I_link_BLAST_results_to_JBrowse" class="mw-headline">How can I link BLAST results to JBrowse</span>

If you use sequenceserver, you create a custom JBrowse link by creating
a links.rb file and running

    sequenceserver -D database_dir -r links.rb

The links.rb is then a file that gets included by sequenceserver to
generate new links to external resources automatically. In our case, we
parse all the HSPs (high scoring pairs) from the hits from BLAST and
string them together into a single feature (e.g. by taking the min and
max of all hsps)

Note: The links.rb passes us the accession and hsps variables
implicitely. The notation for the query start/end and subject start/end
are shortened as qend, send, sstart, and qstart

We use the addFeatures URL parameter of JBrowse to make the features
appear. For reference, see <a
href="JBrowse_Configuration_Guide#Controlling_JBrowse_with_the_URL_Query_String"
class="external free"
rel="nofollow">http://gmod.org/wiki/JBrowse_Configuration_Guide#Controlling_JBrowse_with_the_URL_Query_String</a>

               }]))
               my_track = ERB::Util.url_encode(JSON.generate([
                    {
                       :label => "BLAST",

                       :glyph => "JBrowse/View/FeatureGlyph/Segments"
                    }
               ]))
               url = "http://yourwebsite.com/jbrowse/" \
                            "?loc=#{accession}:#{first_hit_start-500}..#{first_hit_start+500}" \
                            "&addFeatures=#{my_features}" \
                            "&addTracks=#{my_track}" \
                            "&tracks=BLAST" \
                            "&highlight=#{accession}:#{first_hit_start}..#{first_hit_end}"
               {
                 :order => 2,
                 :title => 'JBrowse',
                 :url   => url,

               }
           end
       end
    end

  
Important note: if you have multiple organisms, then you should encode
your FASTA files to contain the organism name, e.g.

    >Human-chr1
    ACCGAATCAGCTATCGA...

  
This is because BLAST does not tell you which database your hits come
from.

  
Then you must modify your links.rb use this information by parsing the
"accession" variable.

    end

  
Another important note: you should BLAST the actual genome sequence if
you are linking to genomic coordinates of JBrowse. If you BLAST a CDS
database, you may need to load CDS sequences into JBrowse, or translate
the CDS coordinates into genomic coordinates

  

Also also note: if you are running sequenceserver through apache e.g.
with Passenger Phusion, then you can modify the config.ru to have a
"require './links.rb'" line and keep the links.rb in that same directory
as config.ru e.g.

    require 'sequenceserver'
    require './links.rb'
    SequenceServer.init(:config_file => ".sequenceserver.conf")
    run SequenceServer

Yes! Try the jbrowse desktop versions, built with electron!

The Windows and OSX versions are easy to use, and all you need is to
open your fasta file (ideally: indexed fasta).

You can also open BAM tracks, BigWig, VCF.gz, GFF3, BED, BigBed, and
more!

## <span id="Can_I_install_the_perl_packages_using_cpanm.3F" class="mw-headline">Can I install the perl packages using cpanm?</span>

Yes! The packages are not hosted on cpan, but you can install them from
github using cpanm

    cpanm git://github.com/GMOD/jbrowse.git

This will install jbrowse scripts such as prepare-refseqs.pl and
flatfile-to-json.pl to, commonly, a folder like ~/perl5/bin if you are
using local::lib, or simply a system folder like /usr/local/bin if using
sudo.

There are a couple scripts that don't work with this such as
maker2jbrowse, but it is otherwise fine to install the perl scripts this
way.

Note: you might also use --notest option to avoid testing all
dependencies

## <span id="Why_does_my_trackList.json_contain_.22className.22_.28even_on_CanvasFeatures.3F.29" class="mw-headline">Why does my trackList.json contain "className" (even on CanvasFeatures?)</span>

className refers to a CSS class for your features.

If you are using CanvasFeatures, this is an unused artifact.

If you are using HTMLFeatures, then you can add custom CSS to make your
feature have a custom class. Note that the "subfeatureClasses" is a
related variable: it is a CSS class for subfeatures.

By default, it would just use the "exon" class for exons or whatnot, but
subfeatureClasses allows you to create a map e.g.

`"subfeatureClasses": {"exon": "myCustomExonCSSClass"}`

## <span id="How_do_I_create_a_Tabix_indexed_GFF" class="mw-headline">How do I create a Tabix indexed GFF</span>

The most reliable way to do this is to use gff3sort from
<a href="https://github.com/billzt/gff3sort" class="external free"
rel="nofollow">https://github.com/billzt/gff3sort</a>

See <a href="http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/06/04/145938"
class="external free"
rel="nofollow">http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/06/04/145938</a>
for a description of their algorithm

  
Note that you can try and use GNU sort (sort -k1,1 -k4,4n) or
genometools (gt gff3 -sortlines) but these both have problems where it
will place child features behind the parent features in the GFF

In JBrowse 1.14, the problem of child features being behind their
parents was fixed so the full GFF3Sort algorithm from @billzt is now not
necessary and a simple GNU sort does work.

## <span id="How_do_I_create_a_Indexed_FASTA.3F" class="mw-headline">How do I create a Indexed FASTA?</span>

JBrowse 1.12+ allow opening FASTA files directly in the browser or via
JBrowse Desktop. Indexed FASTA is however much more efficient as it does
not require being read into memory.

To create an Indexed FASTA, install samtools and run

    samtools faidx yourfile.fa

This will create a file called yourfile.fa.fai. When you want to open up
your own sequence file in JBrowse, you can then use the "Open sequence
file" option, and drag and drop both the .fa and the .fai in the file
area. JBrowse will understand that these are to be used together, and
will open it.

Note: you can also open unindexed FASTA, but it requires parsing the
whole FASTA up front, so this is slow and memory intensive with the
current setup. Indexed FASTA is quite efficient though.

## <span id="Can_I_speed_up_JBrowse_load_time_with_VCF_and_BAM_files" class="mw-headline">Can I speed up JBrowse load time with VCF and BAM files</span>

If the BAM and VCF files you have are large, the BAM index or TABIX
index files can become large as well. Since the indexes must be fully
downloaded before any of the data can be displayed, you can break your
files up by chromosomes, and use {refseq} in a urlTemplate to break it
up into manageable chunks.

E.g.

`"urlTemplate": "myfile_{refseq}.bam"`

That would search for myfile_chr1.bam and myfile_chr1.bam.bai when you
open that track while browsing chr1

  

## <span id="Can_I_add_a_loading_bar_while_JBrowse_is_starting_up.3F" class="mw-headline">Can I add a loading bar while JBrowse is starting up?</span>

Yes, you can configure one. See this section
<a href="JBrowse_Configuration_Guide#Configure_a_Loading_Page"
class="external free"
rel="nofollow">http://gmod.org/wiki/JBrowse_Configuration_Guide#Configure_a_Loading_Page</a>

You could also listen for other milestone events to trigger other
loading events (see DebugEvents plugin for details)

## <span id="Can_I_speed_up_generate-names.pl.3F" class="mw-headline">Can I speed up generate-names.pl?</span>

Try using --completionLimit 0 with the command. It will disable
autocompletion but still allow you to search exact matches.

Note that you can use generate-names with --completionLimit 20 on some
tracks and then generate-names with both --incremental and
--completionLimit 0 flags on very information dense tracks.

## <span id="How_do_I_add_categories_to_the_Hierarchical_data_selector.3F" class="mw-headline">How do I add categories to the Hierarchical data selector?</span>

The hierarchical data selector can support multiple levels of drop down
categories. To use this, set the "category" variable on your track, and
use a "/" to represent a subcategory. Use multiple / for multiple
subcategories.

Example

        {
         "category": "ParentCatgory / DiseaseBAM",
         "label": "myTrack",
         "storeClass": "JBrowse/Store/SeqFeature/BAM",
         "type": "Alignments2";
        },
        {
         "category": "ParentCatgory / NonDiseaseBAM",
         "label": "myTrack2",
         "storeClass": "JBrowse/Store/SeqFeature/BAM",
         "type": "Alignments2";
        }

In tracks.conf form

    [tracks.myTrack]
    category=ParentCategory / DiseaseBAM
    type=Alignments2
    storeClass=JBrowse/Store/SeqFeature/BAM

## <span id="How_do_I_collapse_categories_in_the_Hierarchical_data_selector_by_default.3F" class="mw-headline">How do I collapse categories in the Hierarchical data selector by default?</span>

You can set the following config

    collapseCategories=ParentCategory1/ChildCategory,ParentCategory2/ChildCategory

  
etc. to your jbrowse.conf. This is a comma separated list (don't include
spaces around the slashes though). Remember, don't quote the values in
the jbrowse.conf file :)

## <span id="How_can_I_only_load_a_specific_type_of_feature_from_my_GFF_file.3F" class="mw-headline">How can I only load a specific type of feature from my GFF file?</span>

You can use the --type argument for flatfile-to-json.pl

E.g.

`flatfile-to-json.pl --type mRNA —gff mygff.gff`

This will only load mRNAs from the GFF. Additionally, if you want to
filter on the source column of the GFF, you can augment the --type
argument with an extra formatted parameter for source --type
mRNA:augustus

The --type argument can also be a commas separated list of filters like
this.

prepare-refseqs.pl accepts a --sizes parameter, which takes a
"chrom.sizes" file which is just a tab separated file with two columns,
refseq names and their lengths

This let's you view the genome and the features on the genome without
loading the sequence data.

## <span id="How_do_I_install_a_plugin" class="mw-headline">How do I install a plugin</span>

### <span id="Important_note" class="mw-headline">Important note</span>

**After version 1.13 which introduced webpack to JBrowse, then you must
re-run "setup.sh" after adding or removing a plugin.**

**Also, you must use the JBrowse-1.x.x-dev.zip instead of just
JBrowse-1.x.x.zip**

### <span id="Configuration" class="mw-headline">Configuration</span>

To install a JBrowse plugin, generally the easiest thing to do is to put
the code in the plugins directory (e.g. clone the repo to
plugins/GCContent or plugins/SashimiPlot), and then just say this in
your jbrowse.conf (or tracks.conf

    [GENERAL]
    plugins += GCContent
    plugins += SashimiPlot

Equivalently, in jbrowse_conf.json (or trackList.json), that would mean
just having

  

    "plugins": ["GCContent", "SashimiPlot"]

Essentially, you are just giving the configuration an array of folder
names to look for in the plugins directory

Alternatively, you can also add the "name" and "location" of the plugin
too.

  

    "plugins": [{
        "name": "GCContent",
        "location": "plugins/gccontent"
    }]

  
Here "plugins.GCContent" means that the "name" of your plugin is
"GCContent". This is slightly important, because the "name" is used for
the purposes of the "namespace" that the plugin has i.e., when you
specify a track with the "type": "GCContent/View/Track/GCContentXY" in
trackList.json, then that means the "name" of the plugin should be
GCContent, not lowercase gccontent.

  
Note that the above config would be equivalent to this in the
jbrowse.conf format

    [ plugins.GCContent ]
    location = plugins/gccontent

Again, you don't need to use this format if the name of the directory is
as expected e.g. plugins+=GCContent looks for a folder named GCContent

  
Note: "location" is a relative URL to the jbrowse root directory.
Normally when a plugin is successfully installed, you will get a
console.log message from the plugin saying that it has started up (that
depends on the plugin but most jbrowse plugins just do that by
convention)

Another note: you can add plugins declarations to trackList.json or
tracks.conf instead of jbrowse_conf.json or jbrowse.conf too. In
tracks.conf just put it at the top of the file or underneath a line that
says \[GENERAL\]

Final note: it is best to only include plugins in one file, e.g. put all
the includes in jbrowse.conf or all configs in tracks.conf, not mix them
in different config files.

## <span id="Can_I_create_an_adaptor_for_an_existing_web_service.3F" class="mw-headline">Can I create an adaptor for an existing web service?</span>

If your web service doesn't exactly match the requirements for the
JBrowse REST API tracks, then you can create your own "store class" as a
plugin. This basically just requires one thing:

    bin/new-plugin.pl MyPlugin 

Then, simply make a dojo class (using "dojo declare") in your plugin
that implements a "getFeatures" function. The getFeatures function
receives a query object with query.start, query.end, query.ref e.g. chr1
along with 3 callbacks: featureCallback, finishCallback, and
errorCallback. If there is an error, than call the error callback
obviously. Otherwise, for each feature that you want to display, call
featureCallback with that (use JBrowse/Model/SimpleFeature to represent
the feature). When you are out of features for the query region, call
finishCallback.

Check out the genes store class from the myvariantviewer plugin for an
example of a simple custom adaptor <a

## <span id="What_is_a_plugin_useful_for.3F" class="mw-headline">What is a plugin useful for?</span>

A JBrowse plugin can do a wide variety of things. Some common use-cases
would be

- making a custom track type or visualization
- making an adapter for a new file type or "store class"
- adding new pieces to the user interface

Other things that are extensible include

- accessing custom search backends (the so called "Names API")
- accessing custom filter functions
  <a href="https://github.com/cmdcolin/filterplugin" class="external free"
  rel="nofollow">https://github.com/cmdcolin/filterplugin</a>
- making custom "Save track data" export formats

One cool thing is that when you create a plugin, you can simply
reference it textually in your config file e.g. trackList.json, and then
JBrowse will load the "class" from your plugin and initialize it

Understanding "\*dojo declare\*" and \*asynchronous module definition
(AMD)\* will help you understand the “preamble” on the top of every file
that jbrowse uses, and which you can use in your plugin

In version 1.13 and forward, the plugin system also relies on
re-building JBrowse using webpack. This actually allows you to use ES6
javascript and node js modules in your browser code. Therefore, you
might want to review webpack, babel, and node js module systems

## <span id="How_do_I_create_a_plugin.3F" class="mw-headline">How do I create a plugin?</span>

Let's walk through a simple plugin with the goal of adding something to
the track menu (e.g. where the "About this track" and "Save track data"
options are)

To do this, we can use object- oriented principles to “inherit” from
some existing track type like CanvasFeatures and then extend its
functionality by overriding the functions in a new track type

  
We can inherit a new track type by using the “define” function to
include the dependencies needed in a file, and they are listed in an
array at the top of your file.

First initialize a new plugin using

    bin/new-plugin.pl MyPlugin

Then edit a new file, say plugins/MyPlugin/js/MyTrack.js

  

    define( ["dojo/_base/declare", "JBrowse/View/Track/CanvasFeatures"],
       function(declare,CanvasFeatures) {
       return declare(CanvasFeatures, {
           _trackMenuOptions: function() {
               var opts=this.inherited(arguments); //call the parent classes function
               opts.push( // add an extra menu item to the array returned from parent class function
                   {        
                       label: "Custom item",
                       type: 'dijit/CheckedMenuItem',
                       onClick: function(event) {
                           console.log('Clicked');
                       },  
                       iconClass: "dijitIconPackage"
                   }   
               );  
               return opts;
           }   
       }); 
       }   
    );

Code listing 1. an example custom track type,
plugin/MyPlugin/js/MyTrack.js, that adds an extra track menu item

  

After this, we will have the plugin directory structure like this

    jbrowse/plugins/MyPlugin
    jbrowse/plugins/MyPlugin/js
    jbrowse/plugins/MyPlugin/js/main.js
    jbrowse/plugins/MyPlugin/js/MyTrack.js

The bin/new-plugin.pl helps create the skeleton main.js

Then we can use our new plugin to a config file like jbrowse_conf.json
as "plugins": \["MyPlugin"\]

  
Then edit the trackList.json for an existing track and change \`"type":
"CanvasFeatures"\` to \`"type": "MyPlugin/MyTrack"\`.

That will tell jbrowse to load the MyTrack class from your plugin
instead of the normal CanvasFeatures class.

## <span id="Setup.sh_.22Installing_perl_prerequisites.22_fails_for_me.2C_why.3F" class="mw-headline">Setup.sh "Installing perl prerequisites" fails for me, why?</span>

Inspect your setup.log

If for example it says

Then run

    sudo apt-get install libdb-dev

Then re-run setup.sh

If you see errors for XML::Parser

    sudo apt-get install libexpat1-dev

Then re-run setup.sh

Also make sure you use "./setup.sh" or "bash setup.sh", do not use "sh
setup.sh"

This error is often due to some system issues about compiling libraries
like libpng, and for all intents and purposes can be ignored, as it is
only used in wig-to-json.pl and this is superceded by directly reading
BigWig files (no conversion step needed)

You can follow these instructions for how to setup a BigWig file if
needed <a href="JBrowse_FAQ#How_do_I_set_up_a_BigWig_file.3F"

This message normally means that jbrowse is setup but a genome hasn't
been loaded or located correctly

You can continue by running

  

     bin/prepare-refseqs.pl --fasta yourfile.fa

  
Then reload the page and your genome should be available.

  
Note: If the red box on the "Congratulations page" shows a different
message than just 404 on seq/refSeqs.json, then report the error to
github or the mailing list with as much detail about your setup as
possible.

This can normally be fixed by deleting ~/.cpanm

It may be due to conflict between jbrowse's own cpanm and your system
cpanm, but it should not be too problematic.

Generally deleting ~/.cpanm is harmless, it is a "build" directory
(generally ~/perl5 is the local::lib directory, and in jbrowse's case,
it actually uses an alternate local::lib directory named extlib inside
the jbrowse directory to ensure ease-of-install)

## <span id="What_is_.22Integer_overflow_error.22.3F" class="mw-headline">What is "Integer overflow error"?</span>

From what we have seen, the "Integer overflow error" sometimes appears
on BigWig tracks when your webserver is not configured correctly. It
seems to be due to errors with a "reverse proxy" or something not
forwarding the data properly.

Therefore, it is most likely not due to corrupted bigwig files or
jbrowse bugs, but more probably, due to your server's configuration.

## <span id="Why_do_I_get_a_popup_saying_.22Error_reading_from_name_store.22.3F" class="mw-headline">Why do I get a popup saying "Error reading from name store"?</span>

This error basically says the "search function" from generate-names.pl
isn't working. You can try a couple things to fix the error

1.  Refresh your browser (especially in Apollo, where session can
    expire)
2.  Re-run generate-names.pl
3.  Re-run generate-names.pl --hashBits 16 (manually specifying the
    hashBits can fix error sometimes)
4.  Re-run generate-names.pl with --completionLimit 0 which disables
    autocomplete and makes index smaller
5.  Make sure that the fields you are indexing (e.g. Name or ID) don't
    contain full text descriptions (they should be symbols or
    identifiers, the default hash search won't index keywords but rather
    match prefixes)

Note if there are continued troubles, you can try an alternative search
engine, such as jbrowse_elasticsearch (an experimental plugin)

If you get an error similar to this:

`_Argument "-" isn't numeric in addition (+) at /Library/WebServer/Documents/scbrowse/JBrowse-1.12.0/bin/../src/perl5/Bio/JBrowse/FeatureStream/GFF3_LowLevel.pm line 32, <$f> line 44611._`

Increase maxFeatureScreenDensity to a higher value. This value is by
default 0.5 but if you allow a higher "density" of features, set it to 6
for example and the message should disappear.

  

## <span id="I_get_the_error_.22Too_much_data...chunk_size_xxxxx_exceeds_chunkSizeLimit.22" class="mw-headline">I get the error "Too much data...chunk size xxxxx exceeds chunkSizeLimit"</span>

Several things can happen to cause this (generally on VCF of BAM tracks)

1.  You actually have exceeded the chunkSize during regular loading of
    data. You might see one specific block/region out of your whole
    track is giving this error. In this case, simply increase it.
2.  Your data is actually fairly sparse so when it first starts up, the
    "stats estimation routine", which "doubles" the region it searches
    in until it gets enough data, is failing. If it doubles too many
    times, then the chunk will become large and then hit the limit. In
    JBrowse 1.12.3 a "statsTimeout" configuration was introduced to
    avoid these doublings from consuming too much area.

## <span id="I_set_a_value_in_my_config_file_but_it_isn.27t_working._Why_not.3F" class="mw-headline">I set a value in my config file but it isn't working. Why not?</span>

Some things to check:

  

- Don't add quotes around numerical values in your JSON config files
  e.g. trackList.json. Numbers can remain unquoted. Booleans can too.
  Functions are included in quotes though, because those are evaluated
  at runtime.
- Also don't add quotes around even the strings in the .conf config
  files e.g. jbrowse.conf or tracks.conf files. So use
  `defaultTracks=mytrack1,mytrack2` not
  `defaultTracks="mytrack1,mytrack2"`
- Clear your cache. JSON is often cached pretty strongly. The .conf are
  cached even more. And, additionally, if there is a syntax issue with
  your JSON, it will try and use an older version oftentimes until you
  clear cache.

Also note: specifically with regards to the "defaultTracks" parameter,
defaultTracks is overridden by the users cookies and the &tracks=
parameter in the URL, so to test whether defaultTracks works, clear you
cookies and visit without &tracks in the url. Use alwaysOnTracks or
forceTracks if you want to have it turn on despite cookies/URL.

## <span id="I_get_the_error_.22Too_many_open_files_opening_bucket_log.22_with_generate-names.pl" class="mw-headline">I get the error "Too many open files opening bucket log" with generate-names.pl</span>

If you get the error such as this

  

    Too many open files opening bucket log /path/to/your/data/names/00f/6.json.log at perl5/lib/perl5/Bio/JBrowse/HashStore.pm line 197, <$fh> line 85.

Then try increasing number of files available

  

    ulimit -n 1000

The default can sometimes be as low as 256 (view with ulimit -a)

  

## <span id="How_do_I_fix_the_.22Not_a_BAM_file.22_issue.3F" class="mw-headline">How do I fix the "Not a BAM file" issue?</span>

This is normally due to a module called mime_magic being enabled on your
Apache server. Two options for fixing this are 1. disable mime_magic or
2. configuring custom file types with AddType in your apache
configuration. See
[JBrowse_Configuration_Guide#Apache_Configuration_Note](JBrowse_Configuration_Guide#Apache_Configuration_Note "JBrowse Configuration Guide")
for recommended fixes.

## <span id="What_is_the_error_.22invalid_BGZF_header.22_on_my_VCF_files.3F" class="mw-headline">What is the error "invalid BGZF header" on my VCF files?</span>

Your server is misconfigured for VCF.GZ files, and this can be due to it
thinking that it should set "Content-Encoding: gzip" on the your .vcf.gz
files. Your webserver should actually NOT put "Content-Encoding: gzip"
on your VCF.GZ files. If you think you have this problem, can try using
"curl -I" to view the headers that your server is putting on your VCF.GZ
file.

Note: this issue can be confusing to research about, especially the
"Content-Encoding: gzip" issue, because most information on the web
typically says that it should put "Content-Encoding: gzip" on gzip data,
and this header implies that the client should decompress the content
itself, however JBrowse does not want this to happen because VCF.gz
files are a special type of gzip, specifically, bgzip, so it is manually
decompressed by JBrowse javascript code.

## <span id="My_track_doesn.27t_display_the_gene_names.2C_but_I_expected_it_to._Why_not.3F" class="mw-headline">My track doesn't display the gene names, but I expected it to. Why not?</span>

If you have a very dense track with many features, JBrowse might decide
to hide the labels to save space, but you can force them to display
again by adding this to your trackList.json

`"style":{"labelScale": 0.01}`

This says that the label will be displayed when the zoom level is
greater than 0.01 regardless of how many features are there. The value
0.01 is measured in pixels per base pair, at max zoom level, there are
25 pixels per base pair for example, and when zoomed out farther, each
base takes up less space, hence 0.01 will display the feature names
always if you are reasonably zoomed in.

You can also change maxHeight to a larger value to make the track taller
and see more features.

## <span id="Why_does_my_track_keep_saying_.22Loading.22.3F" class="mw-headline">Why does my track keep saying "Loading"?</span>

This normally means some javascript code for handling the track has
crashed. Check your javascript console for clues on how to fix it. Add a
github issue if it represents a real bug!

Note: you should use the "-dev" packages for debugging, i.e.
JBrowse-1.11.6-dev.zip as opposed to for example JBrowse-1.11.6.zip,
because the -dev package contains "un-minified" source code and more
readable javascript console messages

  

## <span id="My_CanvasFeatures_don.27t_show_up_with_subfeatures.2C_why_not.3F" class="mw-headline">My CanvasFeatures don't show up with subfeatures, why not?</span>

If your GFF does not follow this structure

    gene->mRNA->exon+CDS

Then you need to add extra configuration

Specifically, if it is "transcript" instead of "mRNA" (which is common
for Ensembl GFF for example), then you must set

    "transcriptType": "transcript"

Also, if you only have "exon" and no "CDS", then you need to set the
subParts config (the default settings assumes that both exons and CDS
exist, so if there are only exons, like in a cufflinks output file, then
you need this)

    "subParts": "exon"

If your GFF does not include UTR, but the UTR can be "implied" from the
difference between the exon and CDS boundaries, then you can use this on
your track type to enable them

    "impliedUTRs": true

  
If your GFF file has features with this structure

    match -> match_part

This only has two levels, you might consider just setting the "Segments"
glyph

    "glyph": "JBrowse/View/FeatureGlyph/Segments"

The segments glyph accepts all subfeatures, so match and match_part
structure is fine.

Note: the tips above only apply for CanvasFeatures tracks

## <span id="My_HTMLFeatures_don.27t_show_up_with_subfeatures.2C_why_not.3F" class="mw-headline">My HTMLFeatures don't show up with subfeatures, why not?</span>

HTMLFeatures generally load data at the "transcript" level. This means
that they should be loaded with something similar to --type mRNA when
using flatfile-to-json.pl in order to see the transcript subfeatures

    flatfile-to-json.pl --type mRNA --gff your_genes.gff --trackLabel MyTrack

This means that it loads the features where mRNA would be in column 3 of
your GFF. If it was an Ensembl GFF, you might use instead --type
transcript

Note that this also loses the information about the "parent" gene
feature however, so it might be worth loading an additional track at the
gene level like

    flatfile-to-json.pl --type gene --gff your_genes.gff

This track will not display the transcript and exon subfeatures, but
instead just show a box where the gene is, so this is commonly called a
"gene spans" track

  
Note: If you would like a track that displays with the transcript
subfeatures, you can use the CanvasFeatures type track (i.e. load with
flatfile-to-json.pl --type gene --trackType CanvasFeatures ...)

## <span id="Why_are_my_subfeatures_being_displayed_as_separate_features.3F" class="mw-headline">Why are my subfeatures being displayed as separate features?</span>

Your GFF should use proper ID and Parent relations. Your subfeatures do
not need to themselves have IDs if they have no further subfeatures, but
they must have a Parent pointing to the Parent's ID

Note that it should be spelled Parent, not PARENT

  

## <span id="I_get_the_error_.22Building_and_installing_legacy_bam-to-json.pl_support_.28superseded_by_direct_BAM_tracks.29_..._failed.22" class="mw-headline">I get the error "Building and installing legacy bam-to-json.pl support (superseded by direct BAM tracks) ... failed"</span>

Then note:

- This error message can be ignored. It refers only to not being able to

- If you want to fix it, the issue might refer to a conflict with the
  system version of samtools. Uninstall your system samtools and then
  re-run setup.sh (notably homebrew samtools causes this step to fail)
- Again, this only refers to bam-to-json.pl, which converts entire BAM
  files to json. It is better to use the add-bam-track.pl which simply
  can read BAM files directly from the server with no conversion.

Check that

- The file that you are using is actually the right filetype (i.e. maybe

- The webserver you are using allows Range HTTP headers (apache, nginx,

You can use code such as this

  

    <iframe id="jbrowse_iframe" src="/jbrowse/" scrolling="no" style="width:100%;height:800px;"></iframe>
    <script>
    //https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2090551/parse-query-string-in-javascript
    function getQueryVariable(variable) {
        var query = window.location.search.substring(1);
        var vars = query.split('&');
        for (var i = 0; i < vars.length; i++) {
            var pair = vars[i].split('=');
            if (decodeURIComponent(pair[0]) == variable) {
                return decodeURIComponent(pair[1]);
            }
        }
    }
    // subscribe to jbrowse movements inside of the iframe and update parent page url

    var iframe = document.getElementById('jbrowse_iframe');
    iframe.addEventListener('load', function() {
        var JBrowse = iframe.contentWindow.JBrowse;
        JBrowse.subscribe( '/jbrowse/v1/n/navigate',  function(obj) {
            var shareURL = JBrowse.makeCurrentViewURL();
            var parser = new URL(shareURL);
            window.history.replaceState( {}, "", parser.search );
        });
    });
    // pass the parameters from the parent page into the iframe
    iframe.src = iframe.src + window.location.search;
    </script>

  
With this setup, you can pass URL parameters from the URL of the parent

class="external free"
rel="nofollow">http://localhost/parent_page/?data=mydata&amp;loc=chr1:1..10000</a>
and it will forward those URL params to the jbrowse instance (located at

autoupdated when you change locations

## <span id="What_is_the_benefit_of_using_biodb-to-json.pl.3F" class="mw-headline">What is the benefit of using biodb-to-json.pl?</span>

- You can store more advanced creation in the biodb-to-json.pl conf
  file, allowing for more advanced and reproducible builds of your data
  directory
- You can load data from different sources like Chado, GFF, etc.

In general, using normal commands like flatfile-to-json,
prepare-refseqs, etc work fine though. See setup.sh for how the volvox
sample data combines using biodb-to-json and other techniques.

## <span id="Can_I_make_an_ultra-compact_setting_on_my_features.3F" class="mw-headline">Can I make an ultra-compact setting on my features?</span>

Yes you can!

The styles on "CanvasFeatures" include normal, compact, and collapse

By default, compact divides the height of glyphs by 4, so if you make
the height of your features smaller with style-\>height then when you
set compact it will be ultra compact.

  

## <span id="Can_I_disable_the_histograms_on_a_track.3F" class="mw-headline">Can I disable the histograms on a track?</span>

Yes! Try setting style.featureScale to a very small number like
0.0000000001 (but greater than 0)

## <span id="Can_I_visualize_junctions_from_RNA-seq_data" class="mw-headline">Can I visualize junctions from RNA-seq data</span>

Yes, try out the SashimiPlot plugin!
<a href="https://github.com/cmdcolin/sashimiplot" class="external free"
rel="nofollow">https://github.com/cmdcolin/sashimiplot</a>

It dynamically calculates the splicing coverage of a track or uses
junctions.bed files for junctions

## <span id="Can_I_view_GCContent_on_my_sequence_data.3F" class="mw-headline">Can I view GCContent on my sequence data?</span>

Yes, the GCContent plugin will calculate the GCContent from your
sequence data automatically. See
<a href="https://github.com/cmdcolin/gccontent" class="external free"
rel="nofollow">https://github.com/cmdcolin/gccontent</a>

It works fairly well on mid-size genomes. If you have very large
megabase scale assemblies, then you might consider pre-calculating the
GCContent.

## <span id="Can_I_view_GWAS_results_in_JBrowse.3F" class="mw-headline">Can I view GWAS results in JBrowse?</span>

Yes, the GWASViewer plugin does this.

## <span id="What_do_the_colors_mean_on_the_BAM_files_for_JBrowse" class="mw-headline">What do the colors mean on the BAM files for JBrowse</span>

- Light red is a forward read that is paired
- Super light red is a forward read that is badly paired
- Dark red is a forward read that is missing a pair
- Light blue is a reverse read that is paired
- Super light blue is a reverse read that is badly paired
- Dark blue is a reverse read that is missing a pair
- Grey/black is a read whose pair is on another chromosome

## <span id="Can_I_use_RNA-seq_with_JBrowse" class="mw-headline">Can I use RNA-seq with JBrowse</span>

Yep! The regular alignments track types (e.g.
JBrowse/View/Track/Alignments2) supports RNA-seq and will show spliced
alignments.

Also, there are two special options for RNA-seq that can help decipher
the reads.

- The "Use XS" option is a RNA-seq specific flag that aligners output
  which detects the strand that a read came from according to canonical
  splice site. Enable in config using useXS: true
- The "Use reversed template" option is flag normally used for "stranded
  paired-end RNA-seq" data  and it will make both reads in a pair look
  like they are in the same direction, so for example, reads from a
  plus-strand gene will all appear red, even when one of the reads in
  the pair would normally be blue. Enable in config with
  useReverseTemplate: true

  

## <span id="Can_I_use_long_reads_with_JBrowse.3F" class="mw-headline">Can I use long reads with JBrowse?</span>

Long reads from platforms like nanopore and pacbio pose some challenges
but will work if it is in BAM format. The JBrowse 1.12.3 release also
includes an optimization, cacheMismatches, to enhance speed on long read
tracks. This must be enabled manually in the config at the moment.

## <span id="Can_I_have_subtracks_in_JBrowse.3F" class="mw-headline">Can I have subtracks in JBrowse?</span>

You can make a custom plugin to do this. The "multibigwig" plugin is an
example of this
<a href="https://github.com/cmdcolin/multibigwig" class="external free"
rel="nofollow">https://github.com/cmdcolin/multibigwig</a>

  

## <span id="How_do_I_get_coverage_for_a_BAM_file.3F" class="mw-headline">How do I get coverage for a BAM file?</span>

1.  Use the SNPCoverage track
2.  Use the FeatureCoverage track type
3.  Make a bigwig for your BAM file (recommend: use "bedtools genomecov"
    to convert the BAM to bedgraph, and the convert bedgraph to bigwig
    with UCSC bedGraphToBigWig)

  
Also note: with the third option, you can make it so that your BAM track
has a bigwig when zoomed out, but then shows the reads when zoomed in.
Any CanvasFeatures track can use a bigwig for summary histograms. The
Alignments2 volvox-sorted.bam track is an example of this. See
<a href="JBrowse_Configuration_Guide#Configuring_Summary_Histograms"
class="external free"
rel="nofollow">http://gmod.org/wiki/JBrowse_Configuration_Guide#Configuring_Summary_Histograms</a>

  

## <span id="Can_I_zoom_even_closer_to_the_base_level.3F" class="mw-headline">Can I zoom even closer to the base level?</span>

Yes. You can set the config variable view.maxPxPerBp to a higher value.
To increase, try setting this in jbrowse.conf

`view.maxPxPerBp=50`

Note sometimes the "translations" will appear wrong at high zoom levels,
so don't depend on this for the protein translations

By default, the max zoom level is 25, so setting it to 50 makes you able
to zoom in twice as much.

  

## <span id="How_do_I_change_the_color_of_bigwig_dynamically" class="mw-headline">How do I change the color of bigwig dynamically</span>

The pos_color and neg_color config variables for BigWig tracks accept
callback functions. The phytozome browser has good examples of this with
the VISTA plot tool
