The clients and designers agreed to the following requirements.

### <span id="GMOD_User_Participation_Requirements" class="mw-headline">GMOD User Participation Requirements</span>

1.  You must be a non-profit organization.
2.  You are willing to meet virtually (phone, Skype, AIM, IChat, etc.)
    with the students on a regular basis to first explain what your
    database/web site/organism is about and what makes it unique, and
    then to provide feedback and guidance on the student designs as they
    progress.
3.  You have time to work with students during the time window when the
    course is working on this.
4.  You provide the teaching institution with feedback / student
    evaluation that is requested.
5.  If you use the new design, you give credit somewhere on your web
    site (that is reachable by search engines), to the student(s) who
    created it and to the institution they were attending.
6.  Before meeting with the student you should give some thought to what
    your requirements are. Does the logo need to look good in black and
    white? Does it need to appear in a favicon?

*If you already have a design in mind and you just want it polished,
then this program is **not** for you.* The goals of the program are two
fold. First to provide you with a logo, and second to provide students
with design experience. If you already have a design the students won't
get that experience.

### <span id="Graphic_Design_Student_Requirements" class="mw-headline">Graphic Design Student Requirements</span>

1.  You are willing to meet virtually (phone, Skype, IChat, AIM, *etc.*)
    with your client on a regular basis so that you can understand their
    requirements, and what makes their web site/database/organism
    unique, interesting and useful. This may mean understanding some of
    the biology behind the site.
2.  You make any appointments that you set up.

### <span id="Fees" class="mw-headline">Fees</span>

LBCC required a payment of US\$75 per participating organization. Past
experience has shown that charging clients a nominal fee leads to a
stronger commitment to the projects and to working with the students.
