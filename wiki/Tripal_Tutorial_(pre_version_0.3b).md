## <span id="Introduction_to_Tripal" class="mw-headline">Introduction to Tripal</span>

**Note:** This tutorial was given using a pre-release version of Tripal
v0.3b. Therefore, you will find some differences between what you see on
your screen and what is shown in some of the screen shots below. The
largest difference will be the layout of content on the pages because a
new layout template was created for v0.3b. Also, there will some
additional functionality that is not evident in the screen shots but
will appear in the live version. However, the tutorial is still quite
useful for learning to use Tripal v0.3b.

### <span id="What_is_Tripal" class="mw-headline">What is Tripal</span>

Tripal is a suite of PHP5 modules that bridges the Drupal Content
Managment System (CMS) and GMOD Chado.

<a href="File:600px-WhatisTripal.png" class="image"><img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/e/ea/600px-WhatisTripal.png" width="600"
height="407" alt="600px-WhatisTripal.png" /></a>

### <span id="Content_Management_System" class="mw-headline">Content Management System</span>

*Definition From Wikipedia:*

A **content management system** (**CMS**) is the **collection of
procedures** used to manage work flow in a collaborative environment.
These procedures can be manual or computer-based. The procedures are
designed to do the following:

- Allow for a large number of people to contribute to and share stored
  data
- Control access to data, based on user roles (defining which
  information users or user groups can view, edit, publish, etc.)
- Aid in easy storage and retrieval of data
- Reduce repetitive duplicate input
- Improve the ease of report writing
- Improve communication between users

In a CMS, data can be defined as nearly anything: documents, movies,
pictures, phone numbers, scientific data, and so forth. CMSs are
frequently used for storing, controlling, revising, semantically
enriching, and publishing documentation. Serving as a central
repository, the CMS increases the version level of new updates to an
already existing file. Version control is one of the primary advantages
of a CMS.

### <span id="Drupal" class="mw-headline">Drupal</span>

Drupal is an open-source freely available CMS with thousands of users
and existing sites. Features of Drupal

- A well-supporting community.
- Books, tutorials and online forums for help .
- Hundreds of user-contributed extension modules that are freely
  available.
- Hundreds of user-contributed themes to instantly change the
  look-and-feel of the site
- User management infrastructure.
- Allows for non-coding manipulation of the website contents. Anyone can
  edit content.
- Easy to install and maintain

### <span id="Chado" class="mw-headline">Chado</span>

The session for Chado was presented yesterday
<a href="Chado" class="mw-redirect" title="Chado">Chado</a>, so no need
for introdcutions. However, one thing to remember is that Chado has a
modular structure:



- Audit - for database audits
- Companalysis - for data from computational analysis
- Contact - for people, groups, and organizations
- Controlled Vocabulary (cv) - for controlled vocabularies and
  ontologies
- Expression - for summaries of RNA and protein expresssion
- General - for identifiers
- Genetic - for genetic data and genotypes
- Library - for descriptions of molecular libraries
- Mage - for microarray data
- Map - for maps without sequence
- Organism - for taxonomic data
- Phenotype - for phenotypic data
- Phylogeny - for organisms and phylogenetic trees
- Publication (pub) - for publications and references
- Sequence - for sequences and sequence features
- Stock - for specimens and biological collections
- WWW -



Tripal is also modular along these same designations.

### <span id="Goals_of_Tripal" class="mw-headline">Goals of Tripal</span>

- Simplify Construction of Biological Databases
  - Reduce time of development
  - Reduce costs
  - Reduce technical resources (i.e. programmers, systems admins).
  - A non-technical site administrator can add content without knowing
    PHP, HTML, JavaScript.

<!-- -->

- Greater Flexibility of the Biological Website
  - Social Networking
  - Non-biological content
  - Outreach, tutorials, documentation, protocols, publications

<!-- -->

- Expandability
  - Site can be programmatically expanded in any way
  - Changes to base-code are not needed but modules are added.
  - Availability of an Application Programmer Interface (API)

<!-- -->

- Reusability
  - All code can be shared. Expansion modules created by one group can
    be shared with all.

### <span id="Structure_of_Tripal" class="mw-headline">Structure of Tripal</span>

Tripal is a collection of modules that integrate with Drupal. These
modules are divided into hierarchical categories:

<a href="File:TripalLayers.png" class="image"><img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/0/05/TripalLayers.png" width="393" height="411"
alt="TripalLayers.png" /></a>

The Tripal Core level contains supportive functionality for all other
modules. It contains

- A jobs management utility
- A utility to manage materialized views
- An API for these features
- Functions for managing module specific CV terms
- Functions for interfacing with Chado.

  
The Chado-centric modules provide:

- Edit/Update/Delete for Chado modules.
- Bulk loaders for these data
- Basic visualizations for data in Chado specific for the module
- An API for easily accessing Chado.

  
Analysis modules provide

- Custom visualization for specific analyses (e.g. Blast, KEGG,
  InterProScan, Unigene construction)
- Uses the API from the Tripal Analysis (Chado-centric) module.

  
Applications:

- These are full blown applications that use Tripal, Drupal and Chado
  and typically consist of several Chado-centric modules, Analysis
  modules and custom built modules. (e.g. Breeders Toolbox currently
  under construction).

## <span id="Pre-planning" class="mw-headline">Pre-planning</span>

### <span id="IT_Infrastructure" class="mw-headline">IT Infrastructure</span>

Setup of the prerequisites for Tripal can be the most challenging part
depending on the IT infrastructure currently available for your project.
Tripal requires a server with adequate resources to handle the expected
load and systems administration skills to get the machine up and
running, applications installed and everything properly secure. Tripal
requires a PostgreSQL databases server, Apache (or equivalent) web
server, PHP5 and several configuration options to make it all work.
However, once these prerequisites are met, working with Drupal and
Tripal are quite easy.

  
There are three basic ways you could get a Tripal/Drupal/Chado database
web server available for your site

1.  **Option \#1 In-house dedicated servers:** You may have access to
    servers in your own department or group which you have
    administrative control and wish to install Tripal/Drupal/Chado on
    these.
2.  **Option \#2 Institutional IT support:** Your institution may
    provide IT servers and would support your efforts to install a
    website with database backend.
3.  **Option \#3 Commercial web-hosting:** If options \#1 and \#2 are
    not available to you, commercial web-hosting is an affordable
    option. For large databases you may require a dedicated server.

  
After selection of one of the options that works best for you you can
arrange your database/webserver in the following ways:

1.  **Arrangement \#1:** The database and web server are housed on a
    single server. *This is the approach taken by this course*. It is
    necessary to gain access to a machine with enough memory (RAM), hard
    disk speed and space, and processor power to handle both services.
2.  **Arrangement \#2:** The database and web server are housed on
    different servers. This provides dedicated resources to each service
    (i.e. web and database).

  
**Selection of an appropriate machine**

Databases are typically bottlenecked by RAM and disk speed. Selection of
the correct balance of RAM, disk speed, disk size and CPU speed is
important and dependent on the size of the data. Unfortunately, we have
only tested production installations of Tripal on a limited number of
server configurations. The best advice is to consult an IT professional
who can recommend a server installation tailored for the expected size
of your data.

  
**Note**: Tripal does require command-line access to the web server with
adequate local file storage for loading of large data files. Be sure to
check with your service provider to make sure command-line access is
possible.

### <span id="Technical_Skills" class="mw-headline">Technical Skills</span>

Depending on your needs, you may need additional Technical support....

  
**Tripal already supports my data, what personnel to I need to maintain
it?**

- Someone to install/setup the IT infrastructure
- Someone who understands the data to load it properly

  
**Tripal does not yet support all of my data, but I want to use what's
been done and expand on it....?**

- Someone to install/setup the IT infrastructure
- Someone who understands the data to load it properly
- PHP/HTML/CSS/JavaScript programmer(s) to write your custom extensions

  

### <span id="Why_Use_Tripal" class="mw-headline">Why Use Tripal</span>

Tripal does not yet fully support Chado. We are getting closer, but as
of now, it is still lacking in many areas... ***So why use Tripal?***

1.  If you want to use Chado
2.  You need a web interface
3.  You need CMS capabilities (distributed content editing, user
    management, social networking... i.e. Drupal)
4.  You want to contribute to a community effort to help build a tool
    others can use.
5.  Participate in a community of other database developers using the
    same technology, confronting similar problems and helping each
    other.
6.  It is all open-source and free technology!

## <span id="Pre-Course_Setup" class="mw-headline">Pre-Course Setup</span>

By way of information the following steps were performed prior to the
course. These steps will not be needed during the class but are here for
reference.

### <span id="Software_Used" class="mw-headline">Software Used</span>


database. It is not required for successful operation of Tripal but is
very useful.

``` enter
   cd /home/gmod/Documents/Software/tripal/packages
   wget http://downloads.sourceforge.net/phppgadmin/phpPgAdmin-4.2.3.tar.gz?download
```

  
As root:

``` enter
   cd /var/www
   sudo tar -zxvf /home/gmod/Documents/Software/tripal/packages/phpPgAdmin-4.2.3.tar.gz
   sudo ln -s phpPgAdmin-4.2.3/ phppgadmin
```

  
Copy the `conf/config.inc.php-dist` to `conf/config.inc.php`

``` enter
   cd phppgadmin/conf
   sudo cp config.inc.php-dist config.inc.php
```

  
Set permission for the web user:

``` enter
   cd /var/www
   sudo chgrp -Rh www-data phppgadmin
   sudo chgrp -Rh www-data phpPgAdmin-4.2.3/
```

  

### <span id="Prepare_Apache" class="mw-headline">Prepare Apache</span>

Enable the rewrite module for apache. This is useful so that we can use
Clean URLs with Drupal. Clean URLs are not required but make the page
URLs easier to use. We'll discuss clean URLs later.

``` enter
   cd /etc/apache2/mods-enabled
   sudo ln -s ../mods-available/rewrite.load
```

Next we need to edit the apache configuration file to allow URL
rewrites. We can do this by adding the following stanza to the bottom of
the file /etc/apache2/sites-available/default:

       
       <Directory /var/www/>
          RewriteEngine on
          RewriteBase /
          RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
          RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
          RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php?q=$1 [L,QSA]
       </Directory>
      

Now restart your apache again.

``` enter
sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
```

## <span id="Directory_Overview" class="mw-headline">Directory Overview</span>

For reference, these are the file system directories where important
components of this tutorial are located

## <span id="Database_Setup" class="mw-headline">Database Setup</span>

The postgres database comes pre-installed on the GMOD 2011 VMWare image.
Drupal can run on a MySQL or PostgreSQL database but Chado prefers
PostgreSQL so that is what we will use for both Drupal and Chado.

  
With appropriate command-line access and permissions, which we have on
this VMWare image) the following command can be used to create a new
database user and database for this tutorial.

  
First, become the 'postgres' user:

``` enter
sudo su - postgres
```

  
Next, create the new 'tripal' user account. This account will not be a
"superuser' nor allowed to create new roles, but should be allowed to
create a database.

``` enter
createuser -P tripal
```

      
      Enter password for new role: gmodamericas2011
      Enter it again:  gmodamericas2011
      Shall the new role be a superuser? (y/n) n
      Shall the new role be allowed to create databases? (y/n) y
      Shall the new role be allowed to create more new roles? (y/n) n
      

  
Finally, create the postgres database:

``` enter
createdb tripal_demo -O tripal
```

  
We no longer need to be the postgres user so exit

``` enter
exit
```

  

## <span id="Install_Drupal" class="mw-headline">Install Drupal</span>

### <span id="Software_Installation" class="mw-headline">Software Installation</span>

Drupal can be freely downloaded from the
<a href="http://www.drupal.org" class="external free"
rel="nofollow">http://www.drupal.org</a> website. However, to save time,
the file has been pre-downloaded onto the VMWare image. You can find the
compressed package file here:

`/home/gmod/Tripal/drupal-6.20.tar.gz`

  
We want to install Drupal into our web document root (`/var/www`). We
want to be able to do this as our 'gmod' user. So, first, let's set the
directory permissions to allow this:

``` enter
  cd /var
  sudo chgrp gmod www
  sudo chmod g+rw www
```

  
In the command above we set the group of the directory to be **gmod**
(our user group) and we gave the directory read and write permissions
for the group.

  
Next, we want to install Drupal. We will use the **tar** command to
uncompress the software:

``` enter
  cd /var/www
  tar -zxvf /home/gmod/Tripal/drupal-6.20.tar.gz
```

  
Notice that we now have a `drupal-6.20` directory with all of the Drupal
files. We want the Drupal files to be in our document root, not in a
'drupal-6.20' subdirectory. So, we'll move the contents of the directory
up one level:

``` enter
mv drupal-6.20/* ./
mv drupal-6.20/.htaccess ./
mv index.html index.html.orig
```

  
**Note:** It is extremely important the the hidden file `.htaccess` is
also moved (note the second 'mv' command above. Check to make sure this
file is there

  
Notice that the last of the three `mv` commands renames the `index.html`
file and calls it `index.html.orig`. The `index.html` file was serving
as the home page for the website. Drupal uses an `index.php` page for
it's home page but the web server has preference for the `index.html`
page. So, we move it out of the way.

### <span id="Configuration_File" class="mw-headline">Configuration File</span>

Next, we need to tell Drupal how to connect to our database. To do this
we have to setup a configuration file. Drupal comes with an example
configuration file which we can borrow.

  
First navigate to the location where the configuration file should go:

``` enter
  cd /var/www/sites/default/
```

  
Next, copy the example configuration that already exists in the
directory to be our actual configuration file by renaming it to
`settings.php`.

``` enter
  cp default.settings.php settings.php
```

  
Now, we need to edit the configuration file to tell Drupal how to
connect to our database server. To do this we'll use an easy to use text
editor **gedit**

``` enter
  gedit settings.php
```

  
Find the variable \$db_url and set it to this

``` enter
  $db_url = 'pgsql://tripal:gmodamericas2011@localhost/tripal_demo';
```

  

### <span id="Final_directory_creation" class="mw-headline">Final directory creation</span>

Finally, we need to create three new directories. The first is the
`files` directory which Drupal uses for storing uploaded files.

``` enter
  cd /var/www/sites/default
  mkdir files
  sudo chown www-data:gmod files
  sudo chmod g+rw files
```

  
The above command creates the directory but sets the owner to be the web
server (i.e. www-data) and the group to be **gmod**, with read/write
permissions. This way the web server can write to the directory but so
can we.

  
Also, we need to create two new directories, one for storing module
files we'll be installing and another for themes which we'll also be
installing later:

  
Now create the modules and themes directory

``` enter
  cd /var/www/sites/all
  mkdir modules
  mkdir themes
```

### <span id="Compatibility_with_other_tools" class="mw-headline">Compatibility with other tools</span>

We want to ensure that our Drupal installation doesn't interfere with
other web-based tools, such as GBrowse. We need update a setting in the
.htaccess file that came with Drupal which instructs the web server to
look for both `index.php` and `index.html` files when serving pages.

Use 'gedit' to modify the `/var/www.htaccess` file.

``` enter
   cd /var/www
   gedit .htaccess
```

Locate the line `DirectoryIndex` and change it to mach the following:

``` enter
  DirectoryIndex index.php index.html
```

### <span id="Web-based_Steps" class="mw-headline">Web-based Steps</span>

Navigate to the installation page of our new web site
<a href="http://localhost/install.php" class="external free"
rel="nofollow">http://localhost/install.php</a>

<a href="File:800px-Install1.png" class="image"><img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/e/e6/800px-Install1.png" width="800"
height="475" alt="800px-Install1.png" /></a>

  
Click the link in the middle section that reads **Install Drupal in
English**

<a href="File:800px-Tripal_Install2.png" class="image"><img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/5/51/800px-Tripal_Install2.png" width="800"
height="475" alt="800px-Tripal Install2.png" /></a>

  
When the progress bar shows completing the page will switch to a
configuration page with some final settings.

<a href="File:800px-Tripal-install3.png" class="image"><img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/5/53/800px-Tripal-install3.png" width="800"
height="475" alt="800px-Tripal-install3.png" /></a>

  
Set the following

- Site Name: Tripal Demo
- Site email: Your email address
- Administrator Username: administrator (all lower-case)
- Administrator Email: Your email address
- Password: gmodamericas2011
- Default time zone: leave as is
- Clean URLs: enabled
- Update Notification: check for updates automatically

  
Now, click the **Save and Continue** button. You will see a message
about unable to send an email. This is safe to ignore as email
capabilities are not fully enabled on this VMWare image. Now, your site
is enabled. Click the link **Your new site**:

<a href="File:800px-Tripal_Install4.png" class="image"><img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/8/8c/800px-Tripal_Install4.png" width="800"
height="475" alt="800px-Tripal Install4.png" /></a>

### <span id="Drupal_Cron_Entry" class="mw-headline">Drupal Cron Entry</span>

The last step for installing Drupal is setting up the automatted Cron
entry. The Drupal cron is used to automatically execute necessary
housekeeping tasks on a regular interval. Cron is a UNIX facility for
scheduling jobs to run at specific intervals.

Drupal itself requires an entry in the crontab to function. To edit the
cron launch the crontab editor:

``` enter
  sudo crontab -e
```



[A word on text editors such as
nano](Linux_Text_Editors "Linux Text Editors").



  
Add this line to the crontab

``` enter
  0,30 * * * * /usr/bin/wget -O - -q http://localhost/cron.php > /dev/null
```

  
Now save the changes. We have now added a UNIX cron job that will occur
every 30 minutes that will execute the `cron.php` script and cause
Drupal to perform housekeeping tasks.

## <span id="Explore_Drupal" class="mw-headline">Explore Drupal</span>

### <span id="User_Account_Page" class="mw-headline">User Account Page</span>

All users have an account page. Currently, we are logged in as the
administrator. The account page is simple for now. Click the **My
account** link on the left sidebar. You'll see a brief history for the
user and an **Edit** tab. Users can edit their own information using the
edit interface:

<a href="File:800px-ExplorDrupal1.png" class="image"><img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/3/35/800px-ExplorDrupal1.png" width="800"
height="475" alt="800px-ExplorDrupal1.png" /></a>

### <span id="Creating_Content" class="mw-headline">Creating Content</span>

Creation of content in Drupal is very easy. Click the **Create content**
link on the left sidebar.

<a href="File:800px-ExplorDrupal2.png" class="image"><img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/3/3e/800px-ExplorDrupal2.png" width="800"
height="475" alt="800px-ExplorDrupal2.png" /></a>

  
You'll see to content types that come default with Drupal: Page and
Story. Here is where a user can add simple new pages to the website
without knowledge of HTML or CSS. Click the **Page** content type to see
the interface for creating a new page:

<a href="File:800px-ExploreDrupal3.png" class="image"><img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/5/52/800px-ExploreDrupal3.png" width="800"
height="475" alt="800px-ExploreDrupal3.png" /></a>

  
You'll notice at the top a **Title** field and a **Body** text box. All
pages require a title and typically have some sort of content entered in
the body. Additionally, there are other options that allow someone to
enter HTML if they would like, save revisions of a page to preserve a
history and to set authoring and publishing information.

<a href="File:800px-ExploreDrupal4.png" class="image"><img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/f/fc/800px-ExploreDrupal4.png" width="800"
height="475" alt="800px-ExploreDrupal4.png" /></a>

  
Let's create two new pages. A **Home** page and an **About** page for
our site. First create the home page and second create the about page.
Add whatever text you like for the body.

### <span id="Site_Administration" class="mw-headline">Site Administration</span>

#### <span id="Content_Management" class="mw-headline">Content Management</span>

There are many options under the **Administer** link on the left
sidebar. Here you can manage the site setup, monitor and control
content, manage users and view reports.

<a href="File:800px-DrupalAdmin1.png" class="image"><img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/e/e8/800px-DrupalAdmin1.png" width="800"
height="633" alt="800px-DrupalAdmin1.png" /></a>

  
We will not explore all of the options here but will visit a few of the
more important ones for this tutorial. First, click the **Content
Management** link on the left sidebar. You'll see different options.

<a href="File:800px-DrupalAdminContent.png" class="image"><img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/8/88/800px-DrupalAdminContent.png" width="800"
height="633" alt="800px-DrupalAdminContent.png" /></a>

  
Click the **Content** link. The page shows all content available on the
site. You'll see the two pages we created previously:

<a href="File:800px-DrupalContent.png" class="image"><img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/f/fd/800px-DrupalContent.png" width="800"
height="633" alt="800px-DrupalContent.png" /></a>

  
You'll also notice a set of drop down boxes for filtering the content.
For sites with many different content types and pages this helps to find
content. You can use this list to click to view each page or to edit.

#### <span id="Site_Building" class="mw-headline">Site Building</span>

##### <span id="Modules" class="mw-headline">Modules</span>

Click the **Site Building** link on the let sidebar under the
**Administer** link. You'll see several new menu options: Blocks, Menus,
Modules and Themes. First click **Modules**

<a href="File:800px-AdminModules.png" class="image"><img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/4/43/800px-AdminModules.png" width="800"
height="633" alt="800px-AdminModules.png" /></a>

  
Here is where you will see the various modules that make up Drupal. Take
a minute to scroll through the list of these and read some of the
descriptions. The modules you see here are core modules that come with
Drupal. Those that are checked come pre-enabled. Those that are not
checked we will need to install. For this tutorial we will need two
additional modules that are not yet installed. Locate the modules
**Path** and **Search** and check the box next to each of those. Scroll
to the bottom and click 'Save configuration'.

  
The Path and Search modules are now installed. The Search module enables
site-wide searching capabilities for our site and the Path module
enables alternative naming of page URLs (we will discuss later).

  

###### <span id="Module_Installation" class="mw-headline">Module Installation</span>

We can install new extension modules which we will need later. For this
workshop we have several modules that we will need to install but which
do not yet appear in the list of modules. To do this, we must follow
these steps:

1.  Locate and download the extension modules from the Drupal website
2.  Unpack the module in the /var/www/sites/all/modules directory
3.  Check for a README.txt or INSTALL.txt for any further instructions
    for installation of the module
4.  Return the the Drupal 'Administer' -\> 'Site Building' -\> 'Modules'
    page and enable the module.

  
For an example, let's install the **Views** module needed for this
workshop. The views module has been pre-downloaded and saved in the
`/home/gmod/Tripal` directory.

  
First, let's look and see what's there

``` enter
  ls /home/gmod/Tripal
```

<a href="File:800px-TripalhomeDir.png" class="image"><img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/e/eb/800px-TripalhomeDir.png" width="800"
height="360" alt="800px-TripalhomeDir.png" /></a>

  
There are several `.tar.gz` files. These are all Drupal modules we'll be
installing for this workshop. To install the Views module go to our
modules directory, unpack the file.

``` enter
  cd /var/www/sites/all/modules
  tar -zxvf /home/gmod/Tripal/views-6.x-2.12.tar.gz
```

  
Check the README for additional installation instructions

``` enter
  cd views
  ls
  less README.txt
```

*Use the space-bar to scroll through the README.txt file. Hit the 'q'
key to quit*

  
There are not other installation steps besides what we've done. So
return to the **Administer** → **Site Building** → **Modules** page and
enable the module.

  
<a href="File:800px-DrupalViews.png" class="image"><img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/0/03/800px-DrupalViews.png" width="800"
height="491" alt="800px-DrupalViews.png" /></a>

  
Notice that the Views package provided three different related modules
and they all appear under a **Views** category.

  
***EXERCISE \#1***

     Install the Chaos tools modules on your own.  The packages is found here:

     /home/gmod/Tripal/ctools-6.x-1.8.tar.gz

     Enable these modules under the Chaos tool suite category:
     * Chaos tools
     * Custom content panes
     * Page Manager
     * Views content panes

  
Next, we need the JQuery UI module. We will do this one together as it
has a dependency we must install. The package is found here:
`/home/gmod/Tripal/jquery_ui-6.x-1.4.tar.gz`

``` enter
  cd /var/www/sites/all/modules
  tar -zxvf /home/gmod/Tripal/jquery_ui-6.x-1.4.tar.gz
```

  
Check the README for additional installation instructions

``` enter
  cd jquery_ui
  ls
  less README.txt
```

  
The installation file indicates we need to install the JQuery UI package
before we can eanble this module. We must first get this package from
online.

  
Here is a quick command for downloading this file

``` enter
  cd /var/www/sites/all/modules/jquery_ui
  wget http://jquery-ui.googlecode.com/files/jquery.ui-1.6.zip
```

  
Now unzip the package and rename it according to the instructions

``` enter
  unzip jquery.ui-1.6.zip
  mv jquery.ui-1.6 jquery.ui
```

  
Now, return to our Drupal website and enable the Jquery UI module. It
can be found under the **User Interface** category.

  
***EXERCISE \#2***

     Now install the module package Panels found here  /home/gmod/Tripal/panels-6.x-3.9.tar.gz

     Enables these modules under the Panels category:
     * Mini panels
     * Panel nodes
     * Panels

  
***EXERCISE \#3***

     For this last exercise, we need to install the Content-Construction Toolkit (CCK) module.
     For this exercise we will download the file from the Drupal site: http://drupal.org/project/cck.
     Be sure to download the 6.x-2.9 version.  Follow the same installation steps as performed
     previously.  Enable all modules under the CCK category.

  
For reference, the modules installed above can be found here:

- CTools:
  <a href="http://drupal.org/project/ctools" class="external free"
  rel="nofollow">http://drupal.org/project/ctools</a>
- Views: <a href="http://drupal.org/project/views" class="external free"

- CCK: <a href="http://drupal.org/project/cck" class="external free"
  rel="nofollow">http://drupal.org/project/cck</a>

##### <span id="Themes" class="mw-headline">Themes</span>

Next, click the **Themes** link under **Administer** → **Site Building**
on the left sidebar.

<a href="File:800px-DrupalThemes.png" class="image"><img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/1/1a/800px-DrupalThemes.png" width="800"
height="633" alt="800px-DrupalThemes.png" /></a>

  
Here, you'll see a list of themes that come with Drupal by default. If
you scroll down you'll see that one theme named **Garland** is enabled
and set as default. The current look of the site is using the Garland
them. Change the them by checking the **Enable** checkbox and the
**default** radio button for the **Pushbutton** theme and then clicking
**Save configuration**. Now you'll see that the theme has changed.

<a href="File:800px-DrupalThemes2.png" class="image"><img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/8/8d/800px-DrupalThemes2.png" width="800"
height="522" alt="800px-DrupalThemes2.png" /></a>

  

###### <span id="Theme_Installation" class="mw-headline">Theme Installation</span>

Drupal allows us to install new themes. Installation of themes involves
these steps:

1.  Locate and download a theme from the Drupal website
    (<a href="http://www.drupal.org/themes" class="external free"
    rel="nofollow">http://www.drupal.org/themes</a>)
2.  Unpack the theme in the /var/www/sites/all/themes directory
3.  Return to the Drupal **Administer** → **Site Building** → **Themes**
    page and enable the theme

For an example, the Sky theme is available in the home directory on this
VMWare image. We'll install that.

``` enter
  cd /var/www/sites/all/themes
  tar -zxvf /home/gmod/Tripal/sky-6.x-3.11.tar.gz
```

  
This should unpack the theme for us. Now, navigate to **Administer** →
**Site Building** → **Themes** and enable the 'Sky' theme:

<a href="File:800px-DrupalThemes3.png" class="image"><img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/2/2e/800px-DrupalThemes3.png" width="800"
height="522" alt="800px-DrupalThemes3.png" /></a>

  
The sky theme was obtained at this address:
<a href="http://drupal.org/project/sky" class="external free"
rel="nofollow">http://drupal.org/project/sky</a>

  

##### <span id="Blocks" class="mw-headline">Blocks</span>

Blocks in Drupal are used to provide content in regions of a Drupal
theme. For example, navigate to **Adminster** → **Site Building** →
**Blocks**.

You'll see that regions of the theme have been identified. Within the
**Sky** theme you can see the regions with dashed lines around them.
Also, you'll see a list of available blocks. You can select where blocks
will appear by selecting the region in the drop down list. Blocks may
also be hidden, if desired, by selecting **\<none\>** in the dropdown.

<a href="File:800px-DrupalBlocks.png" class="image"><img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/8/83/800px-DrupalBlocks.png" width="800"
height="624" alt="800px-DrupalBlocks.png" /></a>

  
***Exercise \#4***

     Take time to turn on and off blocks to see where they appear.  Re-arrange blocks
     by dragging and dropping the cross-hairs beside each one.  Be sure to leave the
     blocks in the configuration shown in the image below finished:

<a href="File:800px-DrupalBlocks2.png" class="image"><img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/c/c4/800px-DrupalBlocks2.png" width="800"
height="515" alt="800px-DrupalBlocks2.png" /></a>

##### <span id="Menus" class="mw-headline">Menus</span>

Drupal provides an interface for working with menus, including adding
new menu items to an existing menu or for creating new menus. For the
exercise in the Blocks section above we added the **Primary links** menu
to the **Content top** section of the Sky theme. To view the **Primary
links** menu, navigate to **Administer** → **Site building** →
**Menus**.

<a href="File:800px-DrupalMenus1.png" class="image"><img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/4/42/800px-DrupalMenus1.png" width="800"
height="624" alt="800px-DrupalMenus1.png" /></a>

  
Select the menu **Primary links**. You'll see it currently has no item.

<a href="File:800px-DrupalMenu2.png" class="image"><img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/5/5a/800px-DrupalMenu2.png" width="800"
height="363" alt="800px-DrupalMenu2.png" /></a>

  
As a demonstration for working with menus we'll add two menu items for
the Home and About pages we created earlier. To do so, click the **Add
item** tab. You will see a form for providing information about the menu
item to be added.

<a href="File:800px-DrupalMenuAdd.png" class="image"><img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/2/22/800px-DrupalMenuAdd.png" width="800"
height="516" alt="800px-DrupalMenuAdd.png" /></a>

The first field is the path. We need to find the path for our home page.

  
***Exercise \#5***

     Open new browser tabs or windows and find the About page
     and the Home page we created earlier.

  
The path for a page can be found in the address bar for the page. In
Drupal pages of content are generally referred to as **nodes**. So, in
the address bar for our home page you'll see the address is
<a href="http://localhost/node/1" class="external free"
rel="nofollow">http://localhost/node/1</a>. Our about page should be
<a href="http://localhost/node/2" class="external free"
rel="nofollow">http://localhost/node/2</a> (i.e the first and second
pages we created).

The path for each of these nodes is simply `node/1` and `node/2`.
Returning to our tab where we are adding a menu item, enter the path
`node/1`. We will set the fields in this ways:

- Path: node/1
- Menu Link Title: Home
- Description: Tripal Demo Home Page
- Enabled: checked
- Expanded: no check
- Parent item: \<primary links\>
- Weight: 0

  
The settings above will give the menu link a title of **Home** and put
it on the **Primary Links** menu. We now have a **Home** menu item in
the top just under the header, and our **Home** menu item now appears in
the list of menu items for the **Primary Links** menu

<a href="File:800px-DrupalMenu4.png" class="image"><img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/6/60/800px-DrupalMenu4.png" width="800"
height="515" alt="800px-DrupalMenu4.png" /></a>

  
***Exercise \#6***

     Add a second menu item for our about page and arrange them so that our Home
     link appears first and the About link appears second.

##### <span id="URL_Path" class="mw-headline">URL Path</span>

As mentioned previously, the URL paths for our pages have `node/1` and
`node/2` in the address. This is not very intuitive for site visitors.
Earlier we enabled the **Path** module. This module will allow us to set
a more human-readable path for our pages.

  
To set a path, click on our new **About** page in the new menu link at
the top and click the **Edit** tab. Scroll to the bottom of the edit
page and you'll see a section titled **URL path setting**. click to open
this section.

<a href="File:800px-DrupalAboutEdit.png" class="image"><img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/e/e5/800px-DrupalAboutEdit.png" width="800"
height="327" alt="800px-DrupalAboutEdit.png" /></a>

  
Since this is our about page, we simply want the URL to be
<a href="http://localhost/about" class="external free"
rel="nofollow">http://localhost/about</a>. To do this, just add the word
**about** in the text box. You will now notice that the URL for this
page is no longer
<a href="http://localhost/node/2" class="external free"
rel="nofollow">http://localhost/node/2</a> but now
<a href="http://localhost/about" class="external free"
rel="nofollow">http://localhost/about</a>. Although, both links will
still get you to our About page.

  
***Exercise \#7***

     Set a path of 'home' for our home page.

##### <span id="Site_Configuration" class="mw-headline">Site Configuration</span>

There are many options under the **Administer** → **Site configuration**
page. Here we will only look at one of these at the moment--the **Site
Information** page.

<a href="File:800px-DrupalSiteInfo.png" class="image"><img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/4/4a/800px-DrupalSiteInfo.png" width="800"
height="477" alt="800px-DrupalSiteInfo.png" /></a>

  
Here you will find the configuration options we set when installing the
site. You can change the site name, add a slogan, mission and footer
text to the. Towards the bottom there is a text box titled **Default
front page**. This is where we can tell Drupal to use our new **Home**
page we created as the first page visitors see when the view the site.
In this text box enter the text `node/1`. This is the address of our
home page. We must use the node number here and not our new URL pat of
'home' that we just created. Let's change the name of our site from
**Tripal demo** to **Fly Genes Database** and add a slogan: **Resources
for Fly Genomics**.

  
Now, click the **Save configuration** button at the bottom. You'll see
our site name has changed at the top. Also, if we click the logo image
at the top of the site and it will take you to the front page with our
new home page appearing.

  

###### <span id="Theme_Configuration" class="mw-headline">Theme Configuration</span>

Here we return to theming. There are several configuration options that
are available to help customize the theme for your site. These can be
found by navigating to the **Administer** → **Site Building** →
**Themes** page and clicking the **Configure** tab near the top.

  
Appearing under the **Configure** link will be small menu with a listing
of every theme we have enabled. You should see the **Sky** theme at the
end of this list. Click that theme because that is the one we are using
and want to configure:

<a href="File:800px-DrupalSkyTheme.png" class="image"><img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/d/d5/800px-DrupalSkyTheme.png" width="800"
height="477" alt="800px-DrupalSkyTheme.png" /></a>

  
Here you can turn on and off the presence of the logo, site name,
slogan, mission statement, etc. For this particular theme we can also
adjust background colors and images, link colors, font style and size,
and more. Notice when we added a slogan in the previous step that it did
not appear anywhere on the site. To make it appear, check the box next
to **Slogan**.

  
We also want to add a new logo for our site. Since we'll be loading fly
data we want to add a picture of a fruit fly as our logo. We will use
the following image:

<a href="File:Drosophila.png" class="image"><img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/2/2d/Drosophila.png" width="123" height="75"
alt="Drosophila.png" /></a>

  
This image was taken from Wikimedia Commons
(<a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Drosophila.png"
class="external free"
rel="nofollow">http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Drosophila.png</a>).
Right-click on this image and download it somewhere on your machine.
Next, return to our Drupal theme configuration page and use the Logo
file upload interface on the page to upload this file as our logo.

  
Also set the following for the theme:

- The dark blue header is a bit too dark for our logo image. So, let's
  add a different color that. Find the text box for the header color and
  enter this color: '#EE2222' (red color).
- Set the 'Custom Layout Width' to be 90% to give us more room
- Set the height of the header to be 120px to give a bit more room there
  as well.

  
Then, click the **Save Configuration** button at the bottom. We now have
a new logo and our slogan appears.

<a href="File:800px-DrupalLogo.png" class="image"><img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/4/47/800px-DrupalLogo.png" width="800"
height="477" alt="800px-DrupalLogo.png" /></a>

### <span id="User_Accounts" class="mw-headline">User Accounts</span>

We will not discuss in depth the user management infrastructure except
to point out:

- User accounts can be created here
- Users are assigned to various roles
- Permissions for those roles can be set to allow groups of users
  certain administrative rights or access to specific data.
- How user accounts are created can also be set here.

  

## <span id="Tripal_Tutorial" class="mw-headline">Tripal Tutorial</span>

### <span id="Installation" class="mw-headline">Installation</span>

We're going to use the development version from SVN because it has so
many more features that the current v0.2. A new version, v0.3 will be
released soon and will have many of these features we'll be using in the
development version. A recent version from SVN was downloaded to he
`/home/gmod/Tripal/tripal-svn` directory. The following command was used
to do this. You do not need to perform this step as it has been done for
you:

``` enter
svn co https://gmod.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gmod/tripal/trunk
mv trunk tripal-svn
```

  
However, since this version of Tripal was downloaded to the VMWare image
there have been further updates which we want to include for this
workshop. To get those we need to update the SVN. We can do this simply
by issuing the 'svn update' command:

``` enter
cd /home/ficklin/gmod/Tripal/tripal-svn
svn update
```

  
To install Tripal we need to do the same as we did for the other
modules, with the exception of unpacking the files. The files are
already decompressed. So, let's just copy them to our Drupal modules
directory:

``` enter
cp -R tripal_* /var/www/sites/all/modules
cp -R theme_tripal /var/www/sites/all/themes
```

  
**Note:**: typically, one would download the Tripal package and
uncompress it as we did with the other modules we installed. But since
we're using SVN we just copy it over.

  
There are no special instructions for installing Tripal other than
copying the files so we will now navigate to the **Administer** → **Site
Building** → **Modules** page to install Tripal. Here you'll see a long
list of modules under two categories: Tripal and Tripal Analyses.

<a href="File:800px-TripalModules.png" class="image"><img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/e/ef/800px-TripalModules.png" width="800"
height="477" alt="800px-TripalModules.png" /></a>

  
Enable the module **Tripal core** only. There is now a **Tripal
Management** link under **Administer** with several sub items:

- Create Bulk Loader (under development, not yet functional)
- Install Chado v1.11
- Jobs
- Materialized Views

<a href="File:800px-TripalManagement1.png" class="image"><img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/6/69/800px-TripalManagement1.png" width="800"
height="477" alt="800px-TripalManagement1.png" /></a>

  

### <span id="Install_Chado" class="mw-headline">Install Chado</span>

The first thing we want to do is install Chado. If Chado is already
installed in another database then Tripal can use that Chado as well.
However, for better compatibility with all functionality of Drupal it is
best if Drupal and Chado live in the same database. Instructions for
integrating Tripal with an external Chado database are provided in the
User's Guide but will not be shown in this workshop.

  
To install Chado, simply navigate to the page **Administer** → **Tripal
Management** → **Install Chado v1.11**, read the warning message and
click **Install Chado** when ready.

<a href="File:800px-TripalInstallChado.png" class="image"><img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/a/a5/800px-TripalInstallChado.png" width="800"
height="362" alt="800px-TripalInstallChado.png" /></a>

  
A message will then be given that says
`"Job 'Install Chado' submitted. Click the jobs page for status"`. If we
then click the link *jobs page* we can then see our job in the list:

<a href="File:800px-TripalJobs1.png" class="image"><img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/9/9a/800px-TripalJobs1.png" width="800"
height="362" alt="800px-TripalJobs1.png" /></a>

  
We will continue our installation of Chado in the next section.

  

### <span id="Jobs_Management" class="mw-headline">Jobs Management</span>

The jobs management subsystem allows modules to submit long-running
jobs, on behalf of site administrators or site visitors. Often, long
running jobs can time out on the web server and fail to complete. The
jobs system runs separately in the background using the command-line on
an automated schedule but jobs are submitted through the web interface
by users.

  
Tripal provides two API function calls that allows any module to submit
a job to the queue

- A job sumbission function
- A job status update function

  
So, in the example above we now see a job for installing Chado. The job
view page provides details such as the name of the job, The user who
submitted the job, dates that the job was submitted and job status.

  
Jobs in the queue can be executed in two ways:

- Manually through a command-line call
- Using the UNIX cron to automatically launch the command-line

  
When we installed Drupal we installed a Cron job to allow the software
to run housekeeping tasks on a regular bases. Tripal needs a cron entry
as well to allow for regular execution of jobs in the queue. We will
need to add a second cron entry:

``` enter
   sudo crontab -e
```



[A word on text editors such as
nano](Linux_Text_Editors "Linux Text Editors").



  
Add this line to the crontab

``` enter
   0,15,30,45 * * * * (cd /var/www; php ./sites/all/modules/tripal_core/tripal_launch_jobs.php administrator ) > /dev/null
```

  
This entry will run the Tripal cron every 15 minutes as the
administrator user. For this workshop we do not want to wait 15 minutes
at the most to execute our jobs. So, we'll run the jobs in the queue
manually. We will execute the same command that we used in the cron
above:

``` enter
  cd /var/www; php ./sites/all/modules/tripal_core/tripal_launch_jobs.php administrator
```

  
We should now see that Chado is being installed!

<a href="File:800px-TripalChadoInstalled.png" class="image"><img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/a/ae/800px-TripalChadoInstalled.png"
width="800" height="360" alt="800px-TripalChadoInstalled.png" /></a>

  
Also, we see that the job has completed when refreshing the jobs
management page:

<a href="File:800px-TripalChadoInstalled2.png" class="image"><img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/4/45/800px-TripalChadoInstalled2.png"
width="800" height="362" alt="800px-TripalChadoInstalled2.png" /></a>

  

### <span id="PhpPgAdmin" class="mw-headline">PhpPgAdmin</span>

A nice database management tool is freely available for managing a
PostgreSQL database. It is currently installed on the VMWare image and
is accessible at this URL:
<a href="http://localhost/phppgadmin/" class="external free"
rel="nofollow">http://localhost/phppgadmin/</a>

Let's look at our Chado and Drupal databses using phpPgAdmin by first
logging in with the username **gmod** and password **gmodamericas2011**.
When the tool opens you'll see several databases listed down the
left-hand side. Click the **tripal_demo** database to open the tree.

<a href="File:800px-TripalPhpPgAdmin1.png" class="image"><img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/9/95/800px-TripalPhpPgAdmin1.png" width="800"
height="362" alt="800px-TripalPhpPgAdmin1.png" /></a>

  
Under the **tripal_demo** database you'll see several different schemas:

- chado
- frange
- genetic_code
- public
- so

The **chado**, **frange**, **genetic_code** and **so** schemas were all
installed by our Chado installation. The **public** schema is used by
Drupal. All of the chado tables that we will be using are housed in the
'chado' schema and all tables for Drupal are in the 'public' schema.

  
Open the **chado** schema look at the Chado tables. Then open the
**public** schema and take a look at the Drupal tables

  
The Chado database:

<a href="File:800px-TripalPhpPgAdmin2.png" class="image"><img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/6/6d/800px-TripalPhpPgAdmin2.png" width="800"
height="516" alt="800px-TripalPhpPgAdmin2.png" /></a>

  
The Drupal database

<a href="File:800px-TripalPhpPgadmin3.png" class="image"><img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/a/a4/800px-TripalPhpPgadmin3.png" width="800"
height="516" alt="800px-TripalPhpPgadmin3.png" /></a>

  

### <span id="Install_Additional_Tripal_Modules" class="mw-headline">Install Additional Tripal Modules</span>

Now that we have the core module installed and the Chado database
installed and ready we can install the other Tripal modules.

  
**Note:** For this workshop we will not be using all of the modules
available for Tripal, only those related to the Chado feature module.

  
Return to the **Administer** → **Site building** → **Modules** page and
turn on the following Tripal modules in the order specified:

1.  Tripal DB
2.  Tripal CV
3.  Tripal Organism
4.  Tripal Analysis
5.  Tripal Feature

  
Notice that for some of these modules messages appear after installation
indicating directories being created and Materialize views (we will
discuss these in a bit).

Now, when you visit the **Administer' →** Tripal Management **page you
will see several more administrative options available to you.**

### <span id="Install_the_Tripal_Theme" class="mw-headline">Install the Tripal Theme</span>

Tripal provides a theme for Drupal, but it is designed to be a **base
theme**. This way the site can use any theme you want, but Tripal can
still provide some theming support for the data components it generates.
To enable the Tripal theme, Navigate to the **Adminster** → **Site
Building** → **Themes** page and click the checkbox to Enable the
**Tripal** theme. DO NOT click the **default** radio button for the
Tripal theme. We do not want it to be default. The **Sky** theme should
remain as default.

<a href="File:800px-TripalBaseTheme1.png" class="image"><img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/3/30/800px-TripalBaseTheme1.png" width="800"
height="485" alt="800px-TripalBaseTheme1.png" /></a>

  
Next we have to inform our **Enabled** them (a.k.a the **Sky** theme)
that it should use Tripal as it's base theme. To do this, we need to
edit the .info file in the **Sky** theme directory.

``` enter
   cd /var/www/sites/all/themes/sky
   gedit sky.info
```

  
Scroll to the bottom of the file and add the following line

``` enter
   base theme = tripal
```

  

### <span id="Materialized_Views" class="mw-headline">Materialized Views</span>

Chado is very efficient as a data warehouse but queries can become slow
depending on the number of table joins and amount of data. To help
simplify and speed these queries, materialized views were introduced
into Chado by the GMOD folks.

  
A materialized views will take an SQL query like this

``` enter
   SELECT DISTINCT CVT.name,CVT.cvterm_id, CV.cv_id, CV.name
   FROM {cvterm_relationship} CVTR
     INNER JOIN cvterm CVT on CVTR.object_id = CVT.cvterm_id
     INNER JOIN CV on CV.cv_id = CVT.cv_id
   WHERE CVTR.object_id not in
        (SELECT subject_id FROM {cvterm_relationship})
```

And turn it into this:

``` enter
     SELECT * FROM cv_root_mview WHERE cvterm_id = 100
```

For this to work a table named **cv_root_mview** is created and
populated with the results of the larger query. The query on the
materialized view is there more simple and faster. A side effect,
however is redundant data, with the materialized view becoming stale if
not updated regularly.

Tripal provides a mechanism for updating these materialized views. These
can be found on the **Administer** → **Tripal Management** →
**Materialized Views** page.

<a href="File:800px-TripalMV1.png" class="image"><img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/3/35/800px-TripalMV1.png" width="800"
height="330" alt="800px-TripalMV1.png" /></a>

  
Here we see two materialized views. These were installed automatically
by the Tripal CV and Tripal Feature modules. We need to update these and
populate them with data. To do so, click the **Update** button for the
first one. This will add a job to our jobs management system to update
the view. Now, return to the Materialized Vies page and click to update
the other view as well.

  
So, let's run these two jobs:

``` enter
  cd /var/www; php ./sites/all/modules/tripal_core/tripal_launch_jobs.php administrator
```

  
You can now see that both views are up-to-date on the Materialized Views
Page

<a href="File:800px-TripalMV2.png" class="image"><img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/7/7e/800px-TripalMV2.png" width="800"
height="330" alt="800px-TripalMV2.png" /></a>

  

### <span id="Controlled_Vocabularies:_Installing_CVs" class="mw-headline">Controlled Vocabularies: Installing CVs</span>

Before we can proceed with populating our Chado table with genomic data
we must first load some Ontologies. To do this, navigate to
**Administer** → **Tripal Management** → **Controlled Vocabularies**.
You'll see a page describing the purpose of the module and how to use it
(right now just a shell). On the left hand menu find the link for
'Add/Update Ontology With OBO File' and click that. You'll see the
following page:

<a href="File:800px-TripalAddOntology.png" class="image"><img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/7/76/800px-TripalAddOntology.png" width="800"
height="485" alt="800px-TripalAddOntology.png" /></a>

  
The Ontology loader will allow you to select a pre-defined ontology from
the drop down list or allow you to provide your own to be loaded. If you
were to provide your own, you would give the remote URL of the OBO file
or provide the full path on the local web server where the OBO file is
located. In the case of the file residing remotely, Tripal first
download and the parse the OBO file for loading. If you do provide your
own OBO file it will appear in the saved drop down list for loading of
future updates to the ontology.

For this workshop, need to install these ontologies:

1.  Chado feature properties
2.  Relationship ontology
3.  Sequence ontology

  
Do so by selecting one and clicking the **Submit** button. Repeat this
process for each of the three ontologies. You'll notice each time that a
job is added to the jobs subsystem.

  
Now manually launch these jobs

``` enter
  cd /var/www; php ./sites/all/modules/tripal_core/tripal_launch_jobs.php administrator
```

  
**Note:** Normally, we would also want to load the Gene Ontology.
However, this process will take several hours which we do not have time
for in the lecture. Unfortunately, this means we will not be able to
demonstrate the GO analysis module in this workshop.

### <span id="Organism_Page" class="mw-headline">Organism Page</span>

#### <span id="What_if_Our_Organism_is_Already_in_Chado.3F" class="mw-headline">What if Our Organism is Already in Chado?</span>

Now that we have Chado loaded and populated we would like to create a
**home** page for our species. Chado comes pre-loaded with a few species
already, so we will check to see if our organism is already present. To
do this navigate to **Administer** -\> **Tripal Management** →
**Organisms** → **Configuration**

<a href="File:800px-TripalOrganisms.png" class="image"><img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/e/ec/800px-TripalOrganisms.png" width="800"
height="485" alt="800px-TripalOrganisms.png" /></a>

  
This configuration page has several different options. We will discuss
two of these here. The first is the top section labeled **Sync
Organisms**. In this section is a list of organisms. These are the
organisms that come by default with Chado. Fortunately our Organism is
already in the list: *Drosophila melenogaster*

  
We need to inform Drupal that we have data in Chado that we would like a
web page for. This is what we call **Syncing**. We need to sync Drupal
and Chado so that Drupal knows about our organism. To do this, click the
check box next to **Drosophila melenogaster** and then click the
**Submit Sync Job**.

  
As usual we want to run this job manually:

``` enter
  cd /var/www; php ./sites/all/modules/tripal_core/tripal_launch_jobs.php administrator
```

  
Now that our organism is synced we should have a new page for
*Drosophila melenogaster*. To find out, click the **Organisms** menu
item at the top of the page. This menu item was automatically added when
we installed the Tripal Organism module. On this page we see a list of
organisms that have been "synced" with Drupal and Chado. There should
only be our the one we just synced.

Now if we click the 'fruitfly' link it should take us to our new
organism page:

<a href="File:800px-TripalOrganisms3.png" class="image"><img

height="485" alt="800px-TripalOrganisms3.png" /></a>

  
This page, however is a bit empty. We need to add some details. Click
the **Edit** tab towards the top of the page. Notice two if the fields
are missing content: the description and the organism image

<a href="File:800px-TripalOrganism4.png" class="image"><img

height="485" alt="800px-TripalOrganism4.png" /></a>

  
For the description add the following text (taken from wikipedia:
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drosophila_melanogaster"
class="external free"
rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drosophila_melanogaster</a>):

"The genome of D. melanogaster (sequenced in 2000, and curated at the
FlyBase database) contains four pairs of chromosomes: an X/Y pair, and
three autosomes labeled 2, 3, and 4. The fourth chromosome is so tiny
that it is often ignored, aside from its important eyeless gene. The D.
melanogaster sequenced genome of 165 million base pairs has been
annotated\[17\] and contains approximately 13,767 protein-coding genes,
which comprise ~20% of the genome out of a total of an estimated 14,000
genes. More than 60% of the genome appears to be functional
non-protein-coding DNA involved in gene expression control.
Determination of sex in Drosophila occurs by the ratio of X chromosomes
to autosomes, not because of the presence of a Y chromosome as in human
sex determination. Although the Y chromosome is entirely
heterochromatic, it contains at least 16 genes, many of which are
thought to have male-related functions."

  
For the image, download this image below and upload it using the
interface on the page.

Save the page. Now we have a more informative page:

#### <span id="What_if_Our_Organisms_Isn.27t_Present_in_Chado.3F" class="mw-headline">What if Our Organisms Isn't Present in Chado?</span>

If we have an organism that is not already present in Chado, we can
easily add one using the **Create Content** page. You can find this link
on the left side bar navigation menu. The **Create Content** page has
many more content types than when we first saw it. Previously we only
had **Page** and **Story** content types. Now we have three additional
content types added by the Tripal Analysis, Organism and Feature
modules.

### <span id="Loading_Data" class="mw-headline">Loading Data</span>

#### <span id="Review_of_the_Data" class="mw-headline">Review of the Data</span>

Now that we have our organism ready, we can to being loading feature
data. For this workshop only a few genomic features from the genome of
*Drosophila melenogaster* (obtained from FlyBase) have been selected.
This is to ensure we can move through the demonstration rather quickly.
But Tripal can support very large datasets. Also, we are not loading the
entire compendium of data for these genomic features. Tripal does not
have loaders or visualization pages for all of the data types available
on FlyBase.

  
Below is a summary of the data types Tripal can currently handle for
genomic features:

1.  Genomic loci or features (e.g. genes, mRNA, CDS, EST, contig, or any
    other type in the Sequence Ontology)
2.  Feature relationships (e.g. mRNA part_of gene, protein derived_from
    mRNA).
3.  Feature synonyms
4.  External Database cross-references for features
5.  Feature localizations (e.g. genes are located on chromosomes or
    scaffolds)
6.  Feature properties

  
Also display of analyses results are also available for these methods:

1.  Blast
2.  KEGG
3.  InterProScan
4.  Gene Ontology
5.  Unigene

  
We will demonstrate all of the above with the exception of the Gene
Ontology viewer (because the GO takes too long to load for this course)
and the Unigene (we are not building a unigene set).

  

#### <span id="Loading_a_GFF3_File" class="mw-headline">Loading a GFF3 File</span>

GFF3 files can be parsed and data loaded into Chado using the GFF3
loader that now comes with Chado. The GFF loader supports these
operations:

- Inserting of features into Chado
- Inserting of location of features relative to others (including phase
  and strand)
- Inserting of relationships between features (e.g. parent
  relationships)
- Inserting of external database references for features
- Inserting of synonyms (or Aliases) for features

  
As of the SVN version it does not yet support (but will as time
progesses):

- loading of FASTA sequences at the bottom of the file
- target relationships (between aligned sequences, e.g. blast)
- other non reserved attributes as properties

  
A GFF3 file containing the genes and mRNA sequences we will be using can
be downloaded here:
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/6/6e/Flybase-tripal-demo.gff"
class="internal" title="Flybase-tripal-demo.gff">Flybase demo data</a>
(Aside from filtering the original FlyBase GFF file, no alterations have
been made to this file).

  
Right-click and download this data into the directory
`/home/gmod/Tripal`

  
Now, navigate to **Administer** → **Tripal Management** → **Features** →
**Import a GFF3 file**.

<a href="File:800px-TripalGFF3Import.png" class="image"><img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/6/6b/800px-TripalGFF3Import.png" width="800"
height="485" alt="800px-TripalGFF3Import.png" /></a>

  
Here we will simply choose the organism to which the GFF3 file
describes, enter the path on the file system where our GFF file resides
and select the appropriate import options.

Enter the following values

- Organism: Drosophila melenogaster (fruitfly)
- GFF3 file: /home/gmod/Tripal/Flybase-tripal-demo.gff.txt
- Import option: Import all and update.

  
Click the **Import GFF3 button** when complete. You'll notice a job was
submitted to the jobs substem. Now, to complete the process we need the
job to run. We'll do this manually:

``` enter
  cd /var/www; php ./sites/all/modules/tripal_core/tripal_launch_jobs.php administrator
```

### <span id="Feature_Pages" class="mw-headline">Feature Pages</span>

#### <span id="Syncing_Features" class="mw-headline">Syncing Features</span>

Just as we had to sync our organisms, we must also do the same for our
genomics features. Loading of the GFF file in the previous step has
populated the feature tables of Chado for us, but now Drupal must know
about these features. Similar to the Organism Configuration page there
is also a Feature Configuration page. This can be found by navigating to
**Administer** → **Tripal Management** → **Features** →
**Configuration**.

<a href="File:800px-TripalFeaturesConfig.png" class="image"><img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/8/88/800px-TripalFeaturesConfig.png"
width="800" height="485" alt="800px-TripalFeaturesConfig.png" /></a>

  
The first text box is for specifying internal ID prefix. This is used to
form a unique numeric identifier for each feature in your site. The
number is prefixed with the value chosen here. Enter a value of 'FGD'
for Fly Genes Database.

  
The second text box is for specifying the types of features to sync with
Drupal. You should enter the Sequence Ontology terms for the features
that should have pages on the site. In our case, we want gene and mRNA
pages. Features of these types were present in our GFF file. So, add the
SO terms 'gene' and 'mRNA' to the this box.

  
Now, click the **Save configuration** button at the bottom of the page
to save the changes.

  
Next, we want to sync the 'gene' and 'mRNA' features with Drupal. To do
this, scroll down until you find the **Sync Features** section. click
the **Sync All Features** button. A job is then added to the jobs
management system which we need to manually run.

``` enter
  cd /var/www; php ./sites/all/modules/tripal_core/tripal_launch_jobs.php administrator
```

  
Our features are now synced:

  
<a href="File:800px-TripalFeatureSync.png" class="image"><img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/c/c8/800px-TripalFeatureSync.png" width="800"
height="384" alt="800px-TripalFeatureSync.png" /></a>

  
***Exercise \#9***

     Find the feature pages we just synced.   We previously discussed one way to find content.

#### <span id="Manually_Adding_a_New_Feature" class="mw-headline">Manually Adding a New Feature</span>

In the same way that we created an organism using the **Create content**
page, we can also add a new feature as well. We will not review how to
do this as the steps are the same as for creating an organism. Also, it
is not practical to add all features in this way, but this interface can
be useful for cases where a feature may have been forgotten and needs to
be easily added.

  

#### <span id="Loading_FASTA_files" class="mw-headline">Loading FASTA files</span>

Locate the gene page for the gene named 'CG40042'. Scroll through the
page. Notice, we can see the feature details, synonyms, external
database references, locations for this feature and relationships that
this feature has. We are missing the sequence information. When we
loaded the GFF file there was no sequence data (although our GFF loader
currently doesn't handle FASTA sequences in the GFF file... it will in
the future). So, we need to add the sequence data. We also want to add
peptide information as well.

  
To do this, we will load three FASTA files which you can download from
these links:

- <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/3/36/Flybase-tripal-demo.2LHet.fna.txt"
  class="internal"
  title="Flybase-tripal-demo.2LHet.fna.txt">Media:Flybase-tripal-demo.2LHet.fna.txt</a>:
  2LHet chromosomal sequence
- <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/f/f4/Flybase-tripal-demo.genes.fna.txt"
  class="internal"
  title="Flybase-tripal-demo.genes.fna.txt">Media:Flybase-tripal-demo.genes.fna.txt</a>:
  nucleotide sequences for genes
- <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/a/a2/Flybase-tripal-demo.peptides.fna.txt"
  class="internal"
  title="Flybase-tripal-demo.peptides.fna.txt">Media:Flybase-tripal-demo.peptides.fna.txt</a>:
  translated peptide sequences

Save these files in the /home/gmod/Tripal directory

  
Now,navigate to the **Administer** → **Tripal Management** →
**Features** → **Import a Multi-FASTA file** Page

  
<a href="File:800px-TripalImportFASTA.png" class="image"><img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/d/d2/800px-TripalImportFASTA.png" width="800"
height="537" alt="800px-TripalImportFASTA.png" /></a>

Before loading the FASTA file we must first know the SO term that
describes the sequences we are about to upload. We can find the
appropriate SO terms from our GFF file. In the GFF file we see the SO
terms that correspond to our FASTA files are 'chromosome_arm' and
'gene'. However, the protein sequences were not present in our GFF file
so these will need to be added as new features of type 'peptide'.

We will load our FASTA files in the order they appear for download
above. Use these settings when loading each one:

  
***Loading Flybase-tripal-demo.2LHet.fna.txt (chromosomal sequence)***

- FASTA file: /home/gmod/Tripal/Flybase-tripal-demo.2LHet.fna.txt
- Organism: Drosophila melenogaster (fruitfly)
- Sequence type: chromosome_arm
- Insert & Update: checked
- Do not set any advanced options

When parsing the FASTA file, Tripal assumes that the first word in the
definition line is the unique name for the feature and will try to find
the feature for updating. If it cannot find the feature then it will
insert it.

  
**IMPORTANT:** It is important to ensure prior to importing, that the
FASTA loader will be able to appropriately match the sequence in the
FASTA file with existing sequences or it may add duplicates.

  
The advanced options provide a mechanism for helping the loader find the
unique name (and other information) if the name is not the first word in
the definition line. They also provide a mechanism for generating
relationships and external database references using information that
may be in the definition line as well. This, however, requires knowledge
of regular expressions. A reference can be found here:
<a href="http://www.regular-expressions.info/tutorial.html"
class="external free"
rel="nofollow">http://www.regular-expressions.info/tutorial.html</a>

  
In the case of this first FASTA import, the first word on the definition
line matches the uniquename of our 2LHet feature so we do not need any
advanced options. Click the **Import Fasta File**, and a job will be
added to the jobs system. Run the job:

``` enter
   cd /var/www; php ./sites/all/modules/tripal_core/tripal_launch_jobs.php administrator
```

  
***Loading Flybase-tripal-demo.genes.fna.txt*** We have gene pages for
sequences. If we look back at one of our gene pages, notice that there
is not a database reference to FlyBase, where these sequences came from.
This information was not present in our GFF file because the GFF file
came from FlyBase. We want to add that database reference and can do so
using the FASTA loader.

  
Before we can load this FASTA file we first need to add the 'FlyBase'
database to Chado. To mange external databases, navigate to
**Administer** → **Tripal Management** → **External Database
References** → **Update/Delete Database References**. On this page
appears a singe drop down list of the available databases stored in
Chado.

<a href="File:800px-TripalDBs.png" class="image"><img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/4/44/800px-TripalDBs.png" width="800"
height="537" alt="800px-TripalDBs.png" /></a>

  
Look in the drop down list for an existing **FlyBase** database. Most of
these databases were added automatically be the Chado installation.
However, some of these, including the 'FlyAtlas' and
'FlyBase_Annotation_ID' database were added automatically by the GFF
loader. Since we do not find a database that matches what we want, we
will add our own. To do this, click the link **Add a new external
database**. Enter the following values for the fields:

- Name: FlyBase
- Description: FlyBase: a database for drosophila genetics and molecular
  biology
- URL: <a href="http://flybase.org/" class="external free"
  rel="nofollow">http://flybase.org/</a>
- URL prefix:
  <a href="http://flybase.org/reports/" class="external free"
  rel="nofollow">http://flybase.org/reports/</a>

  
Click **Add**.

  
We now have added a new database! Now, return to the FASTA import page
and use the following values for loading the next FASTA file:

- FASTA file: /home/gmod/Tripal/Flybase-tripal-demo.genes.fna.txt
- Organism: Drosophila melenogaster (fruitfly)
- Sequence type: gene
- Insert & Update: checked
- Under advanced options set the following
  - External database: FlyBase (the database we just created)
  - Regular expression for the accession: ^(.\*?)\s.\*\$

  
Here is the meaning of the characters in the regular expression:

``` enter
  ^         matches the beginning of the line
  $         matches the end of the line
  .         matches any character
  \s        matches a space
  (.*?)\s   matches all characters up to the first space.  The text in parenthesis will be the accession
```

  
Click the **Import Fasta File**, and a job will be added to the jobs
system. Run the job:

``` enter
   cd /var/www; php ./sites/all/modules/tripal_core/tripal_launch_jobs.php administrator
```

  
You should see output from the jobs similar to the following indicating
that the gene sequences were updated and the database cross references
were added:

<a href="File:800px-TripalFastaLoad2.png" class="image"><img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/8/8b/800px-TripalFastaLoad2.png" width="800"
height="322" alt="800px-TripalFastaLoad2.png" /></a>

  
Now, if we visit our feature page, for feature 'CG40042' you can see the
nucleotide sequences for the gene, but if you scroll to the database
references you will also see an entry for our FlyBase database which we
added using the FASTA importer. The link will take you to the FlyBase
website for this feature.

  
***Loading Flybase-tripal-demo.peptides.fna.txt*** The sequences present
in the other FASTA files were already added to Chado by the GFF loader,
so the FASTA loader simply updated those features by added the sequence
information. Their relationships and database references were already in
the database so we didn't need to use the advanced options of the FASTA
loader to add this information. However, the protein sequences were not
added by the GFF loader as they were not present in the GFF file. We
will need to use the advanced options to associate these protein
sequences with the mRNA features from which they are derived.

  
We will need to use the advanced options to associate relationships and
a database reference with these peptides. Here is an example of a
definition line in the FASTA file:



` `

\>FBpp0112427 type=protein;
loc=2LHet:complement(20469..20650,20723..21383,21436..21569,32573..32645);
ID=FBpp0112427; name=CG12567-PA; parent=FBgn0039958,FBtr0113704;
dbxref=FlyBase_Annotation_IDs:CG12567-PA,FlyBase:FBpp0112427,REFSEQ:NP_001015384,GB_protein:EAA46065,FlyMine:FBpp0112427,modMine:FBpp0112427;
MD5=246ea191b614901ccb7ba87d545d6308; length=349; release=r5.34;
species=Dmel;



  
We will use regular expressions to pull out the necessary information.
Return to the FASTA loader and load the final peptide file and use these
values:

- FASTA file: /home/gmod/Tripal/Flybase-tripal-demo.peptides.fna.txt
- Organism: Drosophila melenogaster (fruitfly)
- Sequence type: peptide
- Insert & Update: checked
- Under advanced options set the following
  - Regular expression for the name: name=(.\*?);
  - Regular expression for the unique name: ID=(.\*?);
  - Relationships
    - Relationship type: produced by
    - Regular expression for the parent: parent=.\*?,(.\*?);
    - Parent type: mRNA
  - External Database Reference:
    - External Database: FlyBase
    - Regular expression for the accession: ID=(.\*?);

  
Click the **Import FASTA file** button and then run the job:

``` enter
   cd /var/www; php ./sites/all/modules/tripal_core/tripal_launch_jobs.php administrator
```

  
You should see output where the protein feature was added, along with
relationship information and database cross-reference information:

<a href="File:800px-TripalFastaLoader2.png" class="image"><img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/2/20/800px-TripalFastaLoader2.png" width="800"
height="478" alt="800px-TripalFastaLoader2.png" /></a>

  
Finally, return to the feature page for feature 'CG40042'. We can now
see the protein feature listed in the relationships section of the page.

  

### <span id="Loading_Functional_Data" class="mw-headline">Loading Functional Data</span>

#### <span id="Blast_Results" class="mw-headline">Blast Results</span>

Now that we have our features loaded we want to add some functional data
as well. Prior to the course, a blastx analysis was performed for the
gene squences against the ExPASy SwissProt database. You can find the
results from that job here:

  
<a
href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/5/56/Flybase-tripal-demo.genes.blastx.xml.txt"
class="internal"
title="Flybase-tripal-demo.genes.blastx.xml.txt">Media:Flybase-tripal-demo.genes.blastx.xml.txt</a>.

  
Download this file and save it in `/home/gmod/Tripal`

  
***Exercise \#10***

     Enable the Tripal Blast Module

  
Analyses are similar to organisms and features in that they all have
pages in Drupal. This is to help site visitors associate data derived
from any analysis with information about that analysis. If we provide
enough details the user can see how we performed the analysis and the
date it was performed.

To create an analysis, navigate to the **Create Content** page and
select the content type **Blast Analysis**. Add the following values for
this analysis

- Analysis Name: blastx Dmel genes vs ExPASy SwissProt
- Program: blastx
- Program Version: NCBI Blast 2.2.19
- Source name: FlyBase 2LHet genes FASTA file
- Source version: FB2011_02
- Time Executed: Mar 6 2011
- Description: blastx vs ExPASy SwissProt of four genes from the Dmel
  2LHet chromosomal region to provide evidence of function
  - Blast Settings
    - Database: DB:swisprot:display
    - Blast XML file:
      /home/gmod/Tripal/Flybase-tripal-demo.genes.blastx.xml.txt
    - Submit a job to parse the XML output: checked
    - Parameters: -e 1e-6
    - Check the box 'Use Unique Name'

  
Click the **Save** button. You can now see our new Analysis.

<a href="File:800px-TripalBlastAnalysis.png" class="image"><img

height="410" alt="800px-TripalBlastAnalysis.png" /></a>

  
The analysis also appears under the **Analysis** menu item at the top of
the page.

<a href="File:800px-TripalAnalyses.png" class="image"><img

Now we need to manually run the job to parse the Blast results:

``` enter
  cd /var/www; php ./sites/all/modules/tripal_core/tripal_launch_jobs.php administrator
```

  
The results should now be loaded. if we visit our feature page, for
feature 'CG40042' we should now see blast results at the bottom of the
page

<a href="File:800px-TripalBlastResults.png" class="image"><img

#### <span id="InterProScan_Results" class="mw-headline">InterProScan Results</span>

<span class="dont"> Since the writing of this tutorial, the Tripal

  - Check the box 'Use Unique Name'
  - Check the box 'The input file is in HTML format'

  
Click the **Save** button. You can now see our new Analysis.

<a href="File:800px-TripalInterPro.png" class="image"><img

height="515" alt="800px-TripalInterPro.png" /></a>

  
Now we need to manually run the job to parse the Blast results:

``` enter
  cd /var/www; php ./sites/all/modules/tripal_core/tripal_launch_jobs.php administrator
```

  
The results should now be loaded. if we visit our feature page, for
feature 'CG40042' we should now see blast results at the bottom of the
page

#### <span id="GO_Analysis" class="mw-headline">GO Analysis</span>

We did not have time to load the Gene Ontology because it takes several
hours. So we cannot demonstrate the use of this module. however, we will
take time to see the results on a live production website running
Tripal.

#### <span id="KEGG_Results" class="mw-headline">KEGG Results</span>

To preserve time we will review this by viewing a live production
website running Tripal. Essentially, the steps are similar to that of
creating a Blast or KEGG analysis.

### <span id="Drupal_Taxonomy_.26_Searching" class="mw-headline">Drupal Taxonomy & Searching</span>

#### <span id="Drupal_Taxonomy" class="mw-headline">Drupal Taxonomy</span>

Drupal provides a tagging mechanism that allows the site creator to tag
pages with certain words that categorize the page. Drupal calls this
categorizing mechanism **Taxonomy**. This allows users to search for and
find pages with certain tag words on them.

  
Similar to the controlled vocabularies we loaded earlier, Drupal
maintains it's own vocabularies for these categories. You can find this
interface by navigating to **Administer** → **Content Management** →
**Taxonomy**.

<a href="File:800px-DrupalTaxonomy.png" class="image"><img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/3/34/800px-DrupalTaxonomy.png" width="800"
height="507" alt="800px-DrupalTaxonomy.png" /></a>

  
Here you will some existing vocabularies for **Feature Type**,
**Organism**, **Library** and **Analysis**. If you click the link 'list
terms' you will see that we have no terms in any of the vocabularies.

  
We would like to tag all of our gene pages to enable searching by
category for our feature pages using Drupal's built-in searching
mechanism. To do this, navigate to **Administer** → **Tripal
Management** → **Features** → **Configuration**. Look for the section
titled **Set Taxonomy**. Check the boxes next to **Organism name** and
**Feature type** and then click the **Set/Reset Taxonomy for all
features** button.

  
This will add a job to our jobs subsystem which we want to run manually:

``` enter
  cd /var/www; php ./sites/all/modules/tripal_core/tripal_launch_jobs.php administrator
```

  
Now, if we visit the feature page for feature 'CG40042', we should now
see the taxonomy added to the page

<a href="File:800px-TripalTaxonomyOnPage.png" class="image"><img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/e/e6/800px-TripalTaxonomyOnPage.png"
width="800" height="273" alt="800px-TripalTaxonomyOnPage.png" /></a>

  

#### <span id="Drupal_Searching" class="mw-headline">Drupal Searching</span>

Now that we have added taxonomy terms to our feature pages we want to
enable searching. The first step is to index our feature pages for
searching. Drupal will do this automatically each time the Drupal cron
is run. This is one of the housekeeping tasks that Drupal perfoms.
However, when syncing large data sets we can generate thousands of pages
at a time. The Drupal cron will only index 500 pages at a time. If we
rely on Drupal indexing it will take an extreme amount of time to index
all of our new pages.

Therefore, we can submit an indexing job using Tripal which will index
all of our features pages in one sitting. This can take quite a bit of
time for very large datasets, but once it completes it does not need to
be repeated very often. For small dataset, indexing should complete
quickly.

To submit an job for indexing, Navigate to the **Administer** → **Tripal
Management** → **Features** → **Configuration** page, look for the
section titled **Reindex** and click the **Reindex All Feature nodes**
button.

  
<a href="File:800px-TripalReindex.png" class="image"><img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/5/52/800px-TripalReindex.png" width="800"
height="225" alt="800px-TripalReindex.png" /></a>

  
Then manually run the job:

``` enter
  cd /var/www; php ./sites/all/modules/tripal_core/tripal_launch_jobs.php administrator
```

  
Drupal searching will not work unless all of the pages are indexed. To
see if the site is fully index, navigate to **Administer** -\> **Site
Configuration** -\> **Search Settings**

<a href="File:800px-DrupalSearchSettings.png" class="image"><img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/0/0f/800px-DrupalSearchSettings.png"
width="800" height="515" alt="800px-DrupalSearchSettings.png" /></a>

  
If the indexing status says 100% then all is well and searching will
work. If it is less than 100% then most likely there are other
pages,such as our About page, which have not yet been indexed. To
quickly index these we can manually run the Drupal cron. The Drupal cron
can easily be run by going to this URL:

<a href="http://localhost/cron.php" class="external free"
rel="nofollow">http://localhost/cron.php</a>

  
When the cron completes there will be no output to the browser, but the
page load will stop indicating the cron is complete. Now, return to the
**Administer** → **Site Configuration** → **Search Settings** to see if
the search status is 100%.

  
Next, we need to expose the search box.

***Exercise \#11***

     Drupal provides a "Search" block which is not enabled by default.  Turn on this
     block and place it on the left sidebar just above the navigation menu.

  
The site should now appear with a search box on the left:

<a href="File:800px-DrupalSearchBlock.png" class="image"><img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/4/46/800px-DrupalSearchBlock.png" width="800"
height="515" alt="800px-DrupalSearchBlock.png" /></a>

  
We can now perform searches. For example, to find the gene with the
GenBank accession 'AA439562', enter the accession in the search box and
click Search.

  
Click the **Advanced search** link to open additional searching options
that can be used to refine a search. Notice that the taxonomy terms for
our synced organism and features appears in the list. You can therefore
limit your search results to specific organisms or feature types.

<a href="File:800px-DrupalAdvancedSearch.png" class="image"><img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/f/f1/800px-DrupalAdvancedSearch.png"
width="800" height="515" alt="800px-DrupalAdvancedSearch.png" /></a>

## <span id="Customizations" class="mw-headline">Customizations</span>

### <span id="Panels_.26_Custom_Layouts" class="mw-headline">Panels & Custom Layouts</span>

Suppose we do not like the way the feature page looks. Right now, all
content is presented linearly down the page. We can use the **Panels**
module to correct this. Earlier, as an exercise, we installed the
'Panels' module. To begin using Panels, navigate to **Administer** →
**Site Building** → **Panels**.

<a href="File:800px-DrupalPanels.png" class="image"><img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/e/e9/800px-DrupalPanels.png" width="800"
height="500" alt="800px-DrupalPanels.png" /></a>

  
The Panels configuration page has many options. For brevity we will not
discuss them all. But in short, we want to alter the layout of our
feature pages. We can do this by first enabling the **Node template**.
We can do this by clicking the **Enable** link next to **Node template**
under the '**Manage Pages** at the bottom right of the screen. This will
take you to the **Pages** configuration page where you'll see that the
**Node template** is now Enabled.

<a href="File:800px-DrupalPages.png" class="image"><img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/7/71/800px-DrupalPages.png" width="800"
height="500" alt="800px-DrupalPages.png" /></a>

  
Next, return to the Panels configuration page at **Administer** → **Site
Building** → **Panels**. We now want to create the page layout. We begin
this step by clicking **Node Template** under the **Page wizards**
section.

  
Here, you should select the node type to be 'Feature' because this is
the content type for which we want a custom layout. Next, select the
category. This is where you choose the layout type. Choose the category
**Columns: 2** and then select the second layout named **Two column
bricks**. Click the continue button.

<a href="File:800px-DrupalNodeWizard.png" class="image"><img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/f/f8/800px-DrupalNodeWizard.png" width="800"
height="366" alt="800px-DrupalNodeWizard.png" /></a>

  
The following configuration page will appear. Simply click the
**Finish** button.

<a href="File:800px-DrupalPanelsConfig1.png" class="image"><img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/c/ce/800px-DrupalPanelsConfig1.png" width="800"
height="495" alt="800px-DrupalPanelsConfig1.png" /></a>

  
Finally, we are taken to the Panel configuration page where we can set
all of the parameters. Notice that we are currently set on the
**Layout** section of the configuration.

<a href="File:800px-DrupalPanelsConfig3.png" class="image"><img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/2/2a/800px-DrupalPanelsConfig3.png" width="800"
height="495" alt="800px-DrupalPanelsConfig3.png" /></a>

  
Using the layout interface, the following will be demonstrated (but not
shown here in this tutorial). But first, open to the feature page
'CG40042' so we can watch the changes as we proceed:

- How to remove default content from the panel regions
- How to add content to each panel region
- Adding of blocks in this order:
  - Feature Details in the **Left Above** section
  - Feature Synonyms in the **Left Above** section, just below the
    feature details.
  - Feature References in the **Right Above** section
  - Feature Relationships as Object in the **Middle** section
  - Add any other blocks desired to the **Middle** or lower sections

When finished our page now looks like this:

<a href="File:800px-DrupalCustomPage.png" class="image"><img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/7/75/800px-DrupalCustomPage.png" width="800"
height="495" alt="800px-DrupalCustomPage.png" /></a>

  

### <span id="Adding_a_GBrowse_Image" class="mw-headline">Adding a GBrowse Image</span>

We would now like to add a GBrowse image onto our gene page. Tripal does
not support this directly, but can facilitate this. The easiest way to
add this content is to create a new **Block**. But, we'll have to code a
bit of PHP to do it. So, we need to first turn on the **PHP filter**
module.

***Exercise***

     Enable the PHP filter module

  
Next, we want to create our block. To do this, navigate to **Administer'
*→*** *Site Building **→** Blocks**, then click on the tab,** Add
Block*.

  
<a href="File:800px-DrupalAddBlock.png" class="image"><img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/e/e6/800px-DrupalAddBlock.png" width="800"
height="495" alt="800px-DrupalAddBlock.png" /></a>

  
Enter the values, as shown in the image above:

- Block Description: Feature GBrowse View
- Block Title: GBrowse View
- Block Body: enter the PHP code below

<!-- -->

    <?php
    $nid = arg(1);
    $node = node_load($nid);
    $feature = $node->feature;

    if($feature->cvname == 'gene' or $feature->cvname == 'mRNA'){
       print "<img src=\"http://flybase.org/cgi-bin/gbrowse_img/dmel/?name=$feature->uniquename\">";
    }
    ?>

  
**Note** The URL used for the link in the `img` tag may not work. In
that case, we can change the print statement to use the Metazome GBrowse
(Ideally we would want to use GBrowse installed on our own system):

       print "<img src=\"http://www.metazome.net/cgi-bin/gbrowse_img/Dmelanogaster/?name=$feature->featurename\">";

We'll try the flybase link first. If it doesn't work we can return here
to switch it out for the Metazome URL.

  

Then, under the **Input Format** section, select the radio button **PHP
code**. Now click **Save Block**

  
***Exercise***

     Return to the Panels configuration page for the node template and
     add this new block to our feature page in the Middle section and place
     it as the first item in the Middle section.
