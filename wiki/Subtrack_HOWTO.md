AKA How to display dense qualitative data in linear tracks that resemble
wiggle tracks

### <span id="Browser_Differences" class="mw-headline">Browser Differences</span>

GBrowse and UCSC differ in how glyphs are organized

- In the UCSC browser, the top-level is track, then subtrack, then
  feature/glyph
- In GBrowse, the top-level is track, then feature/glyph. You can have a
  mixture of different glyphs in the same track.

### <span id="How_can_we_make_something_like_a_sub-track_in_gbrowse.3F" class="mw-headline">How can we make something like a sub-track in gbrowse?</span>

- The use case is a linear "feature" that spans the whole display
  window, with all related glyphs (or a single glyph) lined up
  horizontally.
- There are a few ways to do this:

#### <span id="Quantitative_Wiggle_Tracks" class="mw-headline">Quantitative Wiggle Tracks</span>

- This is an easy one, as quantitative glyphs (like xyplot) already span
  the whole chromosome and display in a horizontal line.
- If your data a dense and quantitative, using a wiggle glyph (either
  ***wiggle_xyplot*** or ***wiggle_density***) will be more efficient
- Each experiment (represented as a single feature/glyph in GBrowse)
  looks like a sub-track.
- Some advantages of using WIG *vs.* [GFF](GFF "GFF") are:

There are speed optimizations for both range queries and graphical
rendering.

You also only need one line of GFF in the database for each wiggle_box
track/chromosome.

#### <span id="Non-quantitative_Wiggle_Tracks" class="mw-headline">Non-quantitative Wiggle Tracks</span>

- If you have a large number of scored or non-scored features (\> a few
  thousand/chromosome) as GFF, they will bog down the database and
  probably pile up in a hopeless jumble in the browser.
- You can use the ***wiggle_box*** glyph in this situation.
- This is accomplished by converting the GFF to WIG/BED, then loading
  the data with the `wiggle2gff3.pl` script.
- The wiggle box glyph draws a wiggle track similar to a wiggle density
  plot but using a specified color rather than a density gradient.
- It is a good way to handle very dense data that needs to rendered
  quickly.

An example of a GFF2WIG(BED) script.

    #!/usr/bin/perl -w
    use strict;

    my $name = shift;
    my $desc = shift;

    @ARGV or die "I need three args: name, desc, filename";

    print qq(track type=wiggle_0 name="$name" description="$desc"\n);
    while (<>) {
      chomp;
      my ($ref,$start,$end,$score) = (split)[0,3,4,5];
      $ref =~ s/CHROMOSOME_|chr//;
      $start--; # zero-based, half-open
      $score = 255 if $scoreÂ !~ /^[-.Ee0-9]$/;

      print join("\t",$ref,$start,$end,$score), "\n";
    }

#### <span id="GFF-based.2C_individual_features" class="mw-headline">GFF-based, individual features</span>

- If you have a lot of features (lines in the [GFF](GFF "GFF") file),
  you can load them in the database as individual standalone features,
  with no grouping or containment hierarchy, as long as they have an
  informative source tag that will allow grouping of the features you
  want and exclusion of all others.
- one example would be data that was received in WIG (BED) format but it
  would be better suited for GFF.

An example WIG(BED) to [GFF3](GFF3 "GFF3") converter

    #!/usr/bin/perl -w
    use strict;

    @ARGV > 2 or die "use these args: source_tag primary_tag filename\nNOTE primary_tag must be a valid SOFA term!\n";

    my $source = shift;
    my $type   = shift;

    for (@ARGV) {
      $_ = "sort -k1,1 -k2,2n $_ |";
    }

    print "##gff-version 3\n";
    my $peak_idx = 0;
    while (<>) {
      chomp;
      my ($ref,$start,$end,$score) = split;
      $ref =~ /^([IVX]+|MtDNA)$/ or next;
      # we will assume that bed lines use the proper zero-based, half open system

      $start++;
      my $group = "ID=peak".++$peak_idx.";Name=${source}_$peak_idx";
      print join("\t",$ref,$source,$type,$start,$end,$score,qw/. ./,$group), "\n";
    }

- The source column in [GFF](GFF "GFF") is not semantically constrained,
  so use an informative tag like TF_binding_DPY27. Then, in the
  configuration stanza for the track, use the **group on** option.

<!-- -->

     group on = source

- Also, you can specify a connector between features (default is line)
- Using "group on" is light weight and required less processing of the
  GFF.
- Its primary disadvantage is that you can't get a tidy left-hand label
  for the whole track like you can with wiggle tracks.

#### <span id="GFF-based.2C_multi-level_features" class="mw-headline">GFF-based, multi-level features</span>

- If you have a bunch of [GFF](GFF "GFF") features but you want them
  displayed as anonymous blocks in a single linear feature, reminiscent
  of a wiggle_density or wiggle_box glyph (but without the wiggle), do
  this:
- Create a parent feature that spans the whole chromosome (one per
  chromosome!)
- Make the "real" features sub-parts of the synthetic parent.

<!-- -->

    Example:

    I  my_big_thing    match      1     15000000 .      . . ID=Big_thing_I
    I  my_little_thing match_part 1     1000     1.234  . . Parent=Big_thing_I;Name="Little_thing_1"
    I  my_little_thing match_part 5001  6000     0.234  . . Parent=Big_thing_I;Name="Little_thing_1"
    I  my_little_thing match_part 11000 12000    -2.234 . . Parent=Big_thing_I;Name="Little_thing_1"
    etc...

- Now you have just one big feature/chromosome that can look like a
  wiggle track, with a tidy left-hand label.

<!-- -->

- **Note:** This approach is only recommended if you have a few hundred
  or fewer features/chromosome, as there is some overhead associated
  with loading all subparts of each synthetic parent feature.
