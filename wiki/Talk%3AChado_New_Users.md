- Tried to work through some of the Central Dogma stuff in Chado Best
  Practices. Zheng ran the sample query, which hung his laptop.
- Jim created the Problems template
  [Template:Problems](Template:Problems "Template:Problems") for adding
  notes to documentation pages in the wiki.

Jim was out of town and everyone else attended the Systems Biology
meeting

Lincoln was able to attend today. We looked at Chado tables using a
combination of phpPgAdmin and command line. To do direct SQL queries in
phpPgAdmin, click at the schema level.

Example query:

    select f.name, d.*, fd.* from dbxref as  d, feature_dbxref as fd, feature as f where d.dbxref_id = fd.dbxref_id and f.feature_id = fd.feature_id and accession !='SGD'

Gives:

    name  | dbxref_id | db_id | accession | version | description | feature_dbxref_id | feature_id | dbxref_id | is_current 
    -------+-----------+-------+-----------+---------+-------------+-------------------+------------+-----------+------------

Note that all have the same dbxref_id.

  
Conclusions

- bulk loaded sample yeast gff3 may not create canonical chado data.
  - features all have dbxref = NULL
    - *feature.dbxref_id is nullable; the original design was to have
      the dbxref_id that appears in the feature table to be the
      'primary' dbxref_id. A fairly recent addition was to add a command
      line flag to the bulk loader to allow the user to specify what (if
      anything) should be used as feature.dbxref_id. All others go in
      feature_dbxref.*
  - feature_dbxref acts strange (see example above)
    - *Not strange at all :-) In typical installations, db_id=2 is the
      GFF_source that comes from the GFF3 file. If you take a look at
      the GFF3 that SGD produces, most have a source of 'SGD', but a few
      have a source of 'landmark', which is used by SGD to put a few
      gene features in the overview in a GBrowse display.*
      - OK, it was a little strange--the GFF bulk loader (and the
        underlying bioperl module, Bio::FeatureIO::gff) didn't recognize
        attribute tags of 'dbxref' as dbxref tags (the standard is to
        use 'Dbxref'. I've modified bioperl and the bulk loader to allow
        the lowercase, non-standard dbxref now.
  - other?
- should get XML from a known Chado db and import via XORT or other.
  - talk to Pei Li and Eric Just
