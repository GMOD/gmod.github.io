**Phylogenies! Hacking! Tucson in January!**

An implicit promise of the Tree of Life project is that, ultimately,
expert knowledge of species phylogeny will be accessible and usable by
everybody. In other words, we will all be able to get the species trees
we need, in a useable form, when we need them. The
<a href="http://phylotastic.org/" class="external text"
rel="nofollow">Phylotastic project</a> aims to make that vision a
reality, by developing a loosely coupled system of components that, in
response to a user’s query (a list of taxa plus conditions), will
rectify names, find suitable source trees, prune and graft to get the
right species, estimate branch lengths, and return the results with
metadata on sources and methods.

In June 2012, the HIP (Hackathons, Interoperability, Phylogenies)
working group of NESCent staged a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon" class="external text"
rel="nofollow">hackathon</a> to prototype components of a Phylotastic
system, and implement demos to show their potential. Thanks to 25
participants who responded to an open call (just like this one), that
hackathon was an extraordinary success (see
<a href="http://phylotastic.org/" class="external text"
rel="nofollow">the Phylotastic website for details</a>).

Now we are gearing up for a second hackathon, to take another step
toward providing computable, convenient, credible access to the Tree of
Life. We aim to recruit a diverse group of participants, including
students, faculty, postdocs, and staff of both genders and from
different backgrounds. Only some of the seats at the hackathon will be
filled by expert hackers who spend their time coding. We also need folks
who can:

- Provide knowledge of workflows and downstream uses of trees
- Design user interfaces
- Test software
- Make screencasts, develop tutorials, and document user experiences

Applications are now being accepted to Phylotastic 2, which will take
place January 28th, 2013 to February 1st, 2013 at the
<a href="http://bio5.arizona.edu/about-bio5" class="external text"
rel="nofollow">BIO5 facility in warm and sunny Tucson, AZ</a>.
Information on how to apply is provided below. Partial support (and, if
funds allow, full support) for travel, food and lodging will be
available to each successful applicant who indicates need. We
particularly welcome applications from women and members of
underrepresented groups.
