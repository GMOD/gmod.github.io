<a href="http://ecocyc.org" class="external text" rel="nofollow">EcoCyc,
the <em>E. coli</em> information resource</a> and one of the resources
offered by the [Pathway Tools](../Pathway_Tools.1 "Pathway Tools")
group, is in need of letters of support from the community after
receiving a poor grant review, which could result in a complete loss of
funding on July 1st, 2014. If you are a user of EcoCyc, please consider
<a href="http://brg.ai.sri.com/ptools/ecocyc-letters-of-support.shtml"
class="external text" rel="nofollow">writing a short letter in support
of this vital resource</a>. The deadline for letters is **May 26th,
2014**.

> **ECOCYC FUNDING CRISIS -- DEADLINE MAY 26**
>
> EcoCyc received a very unfavorable grant review in February 2014. We
> are in discussions with the NIH to resolve this situation.
>
> EcoCyc's usage has steadily increased. We made very strong progress on
> our challenging aims from the current grant period, and the project
> has produced many publications. EcoCyc received excellent reviews on
> previous grant applications. Furthermore, the needs of the prokaryotic
> research community for the content and software tools offered by
> EcoCyc have never been higher.
>
> In the worst case, we will lose all funding on July 1, 2014 and be
> forced to re-apply. Even in the best case, we may receive a crippling
> funding cut that causes us to fall behind in its manual literature
> curation effort, and requires us to lay off experienced curation staff
> until funding can be obtained.
>
> These events could seriously undermine EcoCyc, end the project
> altogether, or force us to begin charging usage fees.
>
> To maintain EcoCyc as the free, up to date, and high-quality resource
> that you depend on, please tell the NIH what EcoCyc means to your
> research. Please click the button below to submit a PDF letter of
> support on institutional letterhead, or a short support statement,
> explaining the importance of EcoCyc.
>
> We ask all regular users to submit; a short statement will take less
> than two minutes of your time. Students and post-docs, please ask your
> lab head to submit in addition to your submission.
