# <span dir="auto">News/2013 GMOD Meeting Survey</span>









As we are trying to plan for next years GMOD meeting, we would like to
decide between two venues as soon as possible. To help us decide, we've
put together a simple
<a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/CPC25P5" class="external text"
rel="nofollow">survey</a>. We are asking your help in deciding between:

- San Diego, California in January before or after the Plant and Animal
  Genomes meeting
- Cambridge, England in April before or after the International Society
  of Biocurators meeting.

Each option has its upsides: the Plant and Animal Genomes is a large
meeting attended by several members of the GMOD community, so it would
likely have a fairly high attendance. On the other hand, having a
meeting in Cambridge would make it easier for European members of the
GMOD community to attend. Please share your thoughts with us and take
this
