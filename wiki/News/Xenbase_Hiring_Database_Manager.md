**<a href="http://www.xenbase.org" class="external text"
rel="nofollow">Xenbase</a> is looking for a new database manager.** We
need an experienced software developer / designer looking for a more
senior position or a skilled IT team leader from industry interested in
working in an exciting, flexible, academic research environment

  
This position has four principal areas of responsibility: managerial,
technical leadership, academic and communications. You will be
responsible for managing a staff of 3-6 developers, carrying out
activities such as performance management, staffing, procurement,
budgeting and overseeing daily operations. In your technical capacity
you will design or direct the design of systems architecture, data
modelling, software architecture and user interfaces. You will also help
team members resolve difficult technical issues and provide mentorship.
As a key member of an academic research project you will be involved in
contributing to grant applications and journal articles and
participating in academic conferences, often abroad. There will be
opportunities to undertake exploratory research relevant to Xenbaseâ€™s
goals. Finally, you will communicate with academic collaborators, users
and the university community.

  
Xenbase is the model organism database for Xenopus, a frog used
extensively in biomedical research for understanding gene function in
development and using this system for helping to understand human
congenital disease. Xenbase integrates a wide range of biological data
and makes it available to scientists around the world on a 24/7 basis.

  
The present database integrates a number of applications and tools. The
primary stack serving most of the content consists of an Apache
webserver, WebSphere Java application server, DB2 Database running on
Red Hat Enterprise Linux. This is integrated with a GBrowse genome
browser and MediaWiki instance that run on MySQL. More bioinformatics
tools will likely be integrated in the future (J-browse, web-Apollo,
UCSC browser). There are also numerous Perl and Java based data
pipelines that regularly exchange data with other bioinformatics
resources including NCBI and Uniprot.

  
The database manager will bring a high level of technical competency in
software engineering, database design and administration, and/or
bioinformatics and will have at least 5 years of experience working in
these areas. A B.Sc. or preferably M.Sc /Ph.d in computer science,
software engineering or in bioinformatics or related discipline is
required. A strong working knowledge of molecular biology would be an
asset. You must be currently legally eligible to work in Canada or the
United States and have good team management skills.

  
The position will be in **Zone C** of the U of C **Management and
Professional Staff (MaPS)** portfolio. Excellent benefits; flexible work
hours; an interesting, relaxed and diverse academic environment along
with travel opportunities are just some of the features of this
rewarding position. For more information see <a
