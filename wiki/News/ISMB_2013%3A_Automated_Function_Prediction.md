Those of you attending ISMB may be interested in the Automated Function
Prediction special interest group. The following comes from Iddo
Friedberg, co-chair, on behalf of the AFP 2013 organizing committee:

**The Automated Function Prediction, an ISMB 2013 Special Interest Group
meeting.**

Key Dates:

- April 20, 2013: Deadline for submitting extended abstracts posters &
  talks
- May 9, 2013: Notifications for accepted abstracts e-mailed to
  corresponding authors
- May 16, 2012: Deadline for presenters to confirm acceptance of
  invitation to speak.
- July 20, 2013: AFP SIG preceding ISMB/ECCB 2013, Berlin

Sequence and structure genomics have generated a wealth of data, but
extracting meaningful information from genomic information is becoming
an increasingly difficult challenge. Both the number and the diversity
of discovered sequences are increasing, and the fraction of genes whose
function is known is decreasing. In addition, there is a need for
annotation which is standardized so that it could be incorporated into
function annotation on a large scale. Finally, there is a need to assess
the quality of the available function prediction software.

For these reasons and many more, automated protein function prediction
is rapidly gaining interest among computational biologists in academia
and industry.

The Automated Function Prediction Special Interest Group (AFP SIG) has
been part of ISMB since 2005. We call upon all researchers involved in
gene and protein function prediction and annotation, both computational
and experimental, to submit an abstract to the AFP meeting. Authors of
select abstracts will be invited to give a talk and/or present a poster.
We will also be discussing the upcoming second Critical Assessment of
Function Annotations, or CAFA. CAFA 1 was a highly successful
experiment, engaging 30 groups worldwide, and has resulted in 16
peer-reviewed papers in Nature Methods and BMC Bioinformatics:

We are looking forward to a new and expanded CAFA 2 in 2013-2014, which
will include a cellular component prediction track, and a human-specific
track.

Keynote speakers:

- Patricia Babbitt, University of California, San Francisco
- Alex Bateman, European Bioinformatics Insitute
- Anna Tramontano, "La Sapienza" Universtiy, Rome.
