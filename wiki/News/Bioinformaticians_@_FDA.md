A conceptually new computational cloud paradigm of High performance
Integrated Virtual Environment (HIVE) is being developed at Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research
(CBER) for High Throughput Sequencing (HTS) XL-data storage and
analysis.

A team of professional Bioinformaticians, DB developers, WEB programmers
is being assembled for this purpose. The team will be responsible for
implementing a Sequence Read Archive (SRA) Library and computational
biology analytics tools within HIVE cloud.

  
Bioinformatician tasks will include programming of computational biology
tools, development of new algorithms, adapting existing tools to the
HIVE cloud.

**Education**

- Ph.D in Physics/Math/Biology/Biostatistics or related field

**Skills**

- 2+ years in C/C++ is required. Must have developed a tool/program.
- Expertise in fundamental mathematical models/algorithms
- Solid understanding of bioinformatics concepts: alignments, strings
  and trees, sequences, clustering methods, biostatistics
- GMOD or [Galaxy](../Galaxy.1 "Galaxy") experience is a significant
  plus
- Ability to work in different operating systems: Linux, Windows, Mac;
  development environments: Visual Studio, Eclipse, GCC/GDB;
- Experience in developing parallel and/or multithreaded programs a plus
- Understanding of client/server infrastructure
- Experience with Java, SQL, scripting languages is a plus

**Background**

- Scientific background in Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry or Biology is
  a significant plus.
- Having publications in reviewed journals is a significant advantage

**Environment**

- Ability to work in a collaborative team of highly skilled
  professionals is a must
- Ability to independently work on parts of a project and
  implement/maintain libraries and tools associated with sub-projects is
  a key
- Will be interacting with scientist and regulatory personnel to
  understand and translate requirements into computationally executable
  tasks
