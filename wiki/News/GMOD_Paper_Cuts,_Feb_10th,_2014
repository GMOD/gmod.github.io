**Finding the missing honey bee genes: lessons learned from a genome
upgrade** <sup>[\[1\]](#cite_note-DOI:10.1186.2F1471-2164-15-86-1)</sup>

> The first generation of genome sequence assemblies and annotations
> have had a significant impact upon our understanding of the biology of
> the sequenced species, the phylogenetic relationships among species,
> the study of populations within and across species, and have informed
> the biology of humans. As only a few Metazoan genomes are approaching
> finished quality (human, mouse, fly and worm), there is room for
> improvement of most genome assemblies. The honey bee (Apis mellifera)
> genome, published in 2006, was noted for its bimodal GC content
> distribution that affected the quality of the assembly in some regions
> and for fewer genes in the initial gene set (OGSv1.0) compared to what

> (Amel_4.5)</a> with a new gene annotation set (OGSv3.2), and show that

Interesting findings from the new assembly of the honey bee genome,
including many more genes than were found in the initial assembly. The
<a href="http://hymenopteragenome.org" class="external text"
rel="nofollow">Hymenoptera Genome Database</a> uses numerous GMOD
resources, including [MAKER](../MAKER.1 "MAKER") for automated genome
annotation, [JBrowse](../JBrowse.1 "JBrowse") and
[GBrowse](../GBrowse.1 "GBrowse") for sequence browsing, and
[WebApollo](../WebApollo.1 "WebApollo") for community genome annotation.

  

**Highly Specific and Efficient CRISPR/Cas9-Catalyzed Homology-Directed
Repair in Drosophila**
<sup>[\[2\]](#cite_note-DOI:10.1534.2Fgenetics.113.160713-2)</sup>

> We and others recently demonstrated that the readily programmable
> CRISPR/Cas9 system can be used to edit the Drosophila genome. However,
> most applications to date have relied on aberrant DNA repair to
> stochastically generate frame-shifting indels and adoption has been
> limited by a lack of tools for efficient identification of targeted
> events. Here we report optimized tools and techniques for expanded
> application of the CRISPR/Cas9 system in Drosophila through
> homology-directed repair (HDR) with double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) donor
> templates that facilitate complex genome engineering through the
> precise incorporation of large DNA sequences including screenable
> markers. Using these donors, we demonstrate the replacement of a gene
> with exogenous sequences and the generation of a conditional allele.
> To optimize efficiency and specificity, we generated transgenic flies
> that express Cas9 in the germline, and directly compared HDR and
> off-target cleavage rates of different approaches for delivering
> CRISPR components. We also investigated HDR efficiency in a mutant
> background previously demonstrated to bias DNA repair towards HDR.
> Finally, we developed a web-based tool that identifies CRISPR target
> sites and evaluates their potential for off-target cleavage using
> empirically rooted rules. Overall, we have found that injection of a
> dsDNA donor and guide RNA-encoding plasmids into vasa-Cas9 flies
> yields the highest efficiency HDR, and that target sites can be
> selected to avoid off-target mutations. Efficient and specific
> CRISPR/Cas9-mediated HDR opens the door to a broad array of complex
> genome modifications and greatly expands the utility of CRISPR
> technology for Drosophila research.

**CRISPR** is one of the most exciting recent technological advancements
of the past couple of years. This paper reports new techniques and tools
for using the CRISPR/Cas9 system for complex genome engineering. For

**Analysis of Global Gene Expression in *Brachypodium distachyon*
Reveals Extensive Network Plasticity in Response to Abiotic Stress**
<sup>[\[3\]](#cite_note-DOI:10.1371.2Fjournal.pone.0087499-3)</sup>

> *Brachypodium distachyon* is a close relative of many important cereal
> crops. Abiotic stress tolerance has a significant impact on
> productivity of agriculturally important food and feedstock crops.
> Analysis of the transcriptome of Brachypodium after chilling,
> high-salinity, drought, and heat stresses revealed diverse
> differential expression of many transcripts. Weighted Gene
> Co-Expression Network Analysis revealed 22 distinct gene modules with
> specific profiles of expression under each stress. Promoter analysis
> implicated short DNA sequences directly upstream of module members in
> the regulation of 21 of 22 modules. Functional analysis of module
> members revealed enrichment in functional terms for 10 of 22 network
> modules. Analysis of condition-specific correlations between
> differentially expressed gene pairs revealed extensive plasticity in
> the expression relationships of gene pairs. Photosynthesis, cell
> cycle, and cell wall expression modules were down-regulated by all
> abiotic stresses. Modules which were up-regulated by each abiotic
> stress fell into diverse and unique gene ontology GO categories. This
> study provides genomics resources and improves our understanding of
> abiotic stress responses of Brachypodium.

**Analyses of Hypomethylated Oil Palm Gene
Space**<sup>[\[4\]](#cite_note-DOI:10.1371.2Fjournal.pone.0086728-4)</sup>

> Demand for palm oil has been increasing by an average of ~8% the past
> decade and currently accounts for about 59% of the world's vegetable
> oil market. This drives the need to increase palm oil production.
> Nevertheless, due to the increasing need for sustainable production,
> it is imperative to increase productivity rather than the area
> cultivated. Studies on the oil palm genome are essential to help
> identify genes or markers that are associated with important processes
> or traits, such as flowering, yield and disease resistance. To achieve
> this, 294,115 and 150,744 sequences from the hypomethylated or
> gene-rich regions of Elaeis guineensis and E. oleifera genome were
> sequenced and assembled into contigs. An additional 16,427 shot-gun
> sequences and 176 bacterial artificial chromosomes (BAC) were also
> generated to check the quality of libraries constructed. Comparison of
> these sequences revealed that although the methylation-filtered
> libraries were sequenced at low coverage, they still tagged at least
> 66% of the RefSeq supported genes in the BAC and had a filtration
> power of at least 2.0. A total 33,752 microsatellites and 40,820
> high-quality single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers were
> identified. These represent the most comprehensive collection of
> microsatellites and SNPs to date and would be an important resource
> for genetic mapping and association studies. The gene models predicted
> from the assembled contigs were mined for genes of interest, and 242,
> 65 and 14 oil palm transcription factors, resistance genes and miRNAs
> were identified respectively. Examples of the transcriptional factors
> tagged include those associated with floral development and tissue
> culture, such as homeodomain proteins, MADS, Squamosa and Apetala2.
> The E. guineensis and E. oleifera hypomethylated sequences provide an
> important resource to understand the molecular mechanisms associated
> with important agronomic traits in oil palm.

The newly-sequenced <a href="http://genomsawit.mpob.gov.my/genomsawit/"
class="external text" rel="nofollow">oil palm genome</a> used the
[MAKER](../MAKER.1 "MAKER") automated annotation pipeline. The oil palm
is one of a number of genomics projects taking off in Malaysia at the
moment. Perfect timing for a [GMOD
workshop](../GMOD_Malaysia_2014.1 "GMOD Malaysia 2014")!

  

**Production of a reference transcriptome and transcriptomic database
(<a href="http://cnidarians.bu.edu/EdwardBase/cgi-bin/index.cgi"
class="external text" rel="nofollow">EdwardsiellaBase</a>) for the lined
sea anemone, *Edwardsiella lineata*, a parasitic cnidarian**
<sup>[\[5\]](#cite_note-DOI:10.1186.2F1471-2164-15-71-5)</sup>

> The lined sea anemone *Edwardsiella lineata* is an informative model
> system for evolutionary-developmental studies of parasitism. In this
> species, it is possible to compare alternate developmental pathways
> leading from a larva to either a free-living polyp or a vermiform
> parasite that inhabits the mesoglea of a ctenophore host.
> Additionally, E. lineata is confamilial with the model cnidarian
> *Nematostella vectensis*, providing an opportunity for comparative
> genomic, molecular and organismal studies.
>
> \[...\]
>
> The transcriptomic data and database described here provide a platform
> for studying the evolutionary developmental genomics of a derived
> parasitic life cycle. In addition, these data from E. lineata will aid
> in the interpretation of evolutionary novelties in gene sequence or
> structure that have been reported for the model cnidarian *N.
> vectensis* (e.g., the split NF-κB locus). Finally, we include custom
> computational tools to facilitate the annotation of a transcriptome
> based on high-throughput sequencing data obtained from a “non-model
> system.”

Information and resources for the newly-sequenced cnidarian *E.
lineata*; all genomic data is publicly available at
<a href="http://cnidarians.bu.edu/EdwardBase/cgi-bin/index.cgi"
class="external text" rel="nofollow">EdwardsiellaBase</a>, and can be
searched according to contig ID, gene ontology, protein family motif
(Pfam), enzyme commission number, and BLAST. The alignment of the raw
reads to the contigs can also be visualized via
[JBrowse](../JBrowse.1 "JBrowse").
