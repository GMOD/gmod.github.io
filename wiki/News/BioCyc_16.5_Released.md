# <span dir="auto">News/BioCyc 16.5 Released</span>









<a href="http://biocyc.org" class="external text"
rel="nofollow">BioCyc</a> version 16.5 has been released! 16.5 is a
major new version that includes updates to the [Pathway
Tools](../Pathway_Tools.1 "Pathway Tools") software/database bundle, as
well as significant data updates and website changes.

Selected highlights of the Pathway Tools update:

Mac OS 10.8  
Pathway Tools 16.5 works under MacOS 10.8; previous versions of Pathway
Tools do not.

Phenotype Microarrays and Other Growth Data  
The displays of growth media, growth observations, and phenotype
microarray data has been substantially revised. Tables for growth
observation data on gene and growth medium pages now include aerobicity
and osmolarity information. The page describing all growth media has
been revamped with improved colors and clearer indications (both in the
tables and in the tooltips) of precisely what growth observation data is
available. This page includes a new option to generate a heatmap to, for
example, show how gene knockouts affect growth on different nutrient
sources.

Atom Mappings  
Atom mappings define the correspondence between atoms in the reactants
of a chemical reaction, and the atoms in the products of that reaction.
MetaCyc now contains atom mapping data for thousands of reactions.
Pathway Tools uses that atom mapping data to color conserved moieties
within chemical reactions, both within MetaCyc and for mapped MetaCyc
reactions present in other PGDBs.

Also of interest is the next
<a href="http://bioinformatics.ai.sri.com/ptools13/"
class="external text" rel="nofollow">Pathway Tools workshop</a>, which
will be held jointly with the recurring Biology Phenotype Microarray
workshop. The workshop will be held from March 4-6, 2013 at SRI
International in Menlo Park, CA. From the press release:

> Many research groups are interested in cell modeling, and models have
> begun to gain acceptance and proliferate. But are these models
> accurate and capable of making useful predictions of cell function?
> The last several years have seen significant improvements in
> computational methods for performing phenotypic predictions from
> metabolic network models. The speed with which such models can be
> assembled has also advanced. Similarly, experimental methods for
> high-throughput phenotypic characterization of cells have advanced
> during this time, and in particular, the use of Phenotype MicroArrays
> in challenging and improving models has become more widespread. This
> three-day workshop will bring together researchers in these and
> related areas to define current gaps and explore potential synergies
> between these computational and experimental approaches. Presentations
> describing other aspects of Pathway Tools and Phenotype Microarrays
> are also encouraged.
