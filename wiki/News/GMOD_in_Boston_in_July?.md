# <span dir="auto">News/GMOD in Boston in July?</span>









From Scott on 2010/05/25:



Due to the short notice, I've decided not to have a GMOD meeting before
BOSC/ISMB in July. I am hoping to plan an informal "GMOD lunch" sometime
during BOSC or ISMB for people who are going to the meetings and would
like to get together to chat.



Scott Cain sent this question about the next [GMOD
meeting](../Meetings "Meetings") out to several [mailing
lists](../GMOD_Mailing_Lists "GMOD Mailing Lists") on May 17:



Since the last GMOD meeting in January, I had been hoping to have a
[GMOD meeting](../Meetings "Meetings") around the ISMB and BOSC meetings
in Boston this July. Until this week, though, I had had a difficult time
finding a place where a meeting could be held for a reasonable price.
However, a kind soul at The Broad has offered a meeting space that would
easily accommodate a GMOD meeting for two days before BOSC (either July
6-7 or July 7-8). The only question I have is this: can people make it
to a GMOD meeting with about 2 months notice? Please let me know your
thoughts on this. While there would probably be a registration fee, it
would be fairly low (I'm guessing in the ballpark of \$50).

Thanks,

[Scott](../User%3AScott "User%3AScott")



Scott hasn't heard back, yea or nay, from very many people so far and we
need to make a decision as soon as possible. **If you have any thoughts
on this, please
<a href="mailto:scott@scottcain.net" class="external text"
rel="nofollow">send them to Scott</a> before 3pm Eastern US time on
Monday, May 24.** See the GMOD [Calendar](../Calendar "Calendar") for a
list of what else is going on in July.

Thanks,
