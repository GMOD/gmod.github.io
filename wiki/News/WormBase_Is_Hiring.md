WormBase is <a
href="http://blog.wormbase.org/2011/10/19/wormbase-now-hiring-web-architectdeveloper/"
class="external text" rel="nofollow">hiring!</a> You want to do web
architecture development in support of a project essential to basic
biomedical research.

The <a href="http://www.oicr.on.ca/" class="external text"
rel="nofollow">Ontario Institute for Cancer Research</a> seeks an agile
and adaptable software engineer with a broad skill set and an interest
in applying it to scientific problems. You will assist the team in
designing and implementing a scalable architecture and web interface to
a vast array of biological data supporting a global community of
researchers. This position will be based in Toronto, ON, Canada.

We're looking for someone excited about science, computers, and
technology. You're comfortable working with big data and moving
information between formats, systems, and platforms. You are passionate
about trending technology and social media and how they might enhance
the scientific process. You can work within the constraints of legacy
systems when required and in proposing and evaluating new alternatives
when warranted. In the past, youâ€™ve confronted issues related to
scalability and data management and have created demonstrable solutions
resolving them.

As a web developer, you possess a broad range of skills that you've used
to generate maintainable and stable solutions. You've deployed or
considered things like EC2, Hadoop/Hoop/HBase/HDFS, Map/Reduce, and
NoSQL variants for data management and analysis. You speak Perl
fluently, know what Moose look like, have heard of Catalyst, use MySQL
and interact with it via ORMs, and love git. You actually enjoy writing
documentation and tests. You're not a designer, but can write HTML and
CSS when necessary, know some Javascript and the basics of Ajax. When
required, you can jump in and help out on a variety of tasks that might
not immediately fall under your purview as the needs of the project
evolve. Strong candidates will have an understanding of modern
biological concepts and familiarity with open source bioinformatics
tools like BioPerl and GBrowse. Those from other non-biological science
backgrounds but with strong software engineering skills will also be
considered.

We're a small, dedicated, distributed team. You should work well
independently, and be receptive to exchanging ideas via IM, Google
Hangouts, Skype, social media outlets, conference calls, and email
threads. In short, excellent communication skills are assumed.

Experience: Bachelors degree in Computer Science, Bioinformatics,
Biology or related field with a minimum of three years experience. On
the upper end, a Masters or PhD with 3-5 years suitable experience.

Please send resumes and vitaes to **Todd Harris (todd@wormbase.org)**.
