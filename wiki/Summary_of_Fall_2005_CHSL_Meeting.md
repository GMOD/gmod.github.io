**During the meeting it was suggested that we have a common database
against which to test software. A first step would be to provide
Postgres dumps of existing databases.**

Allen Day suggested that he will provide a Postgres dump of the database
for human, yeast and mouse.

Dave Emmert from Flybase also agreed to give a Postgres dump.

Kara Dolinski will provide yeast dumps.

Scott Cain agreed to make a wiki page which links to said dumps when
they are up.

**The testing recommendations were reviewed.**

**During a conversation about testing, Interface testing was brought
up.**

Brain O'Connor agreed on trying out some tools for interfaces testing.
Http::Unit, Apache::Test were suggested at the meeting. Eric Just
recommended looking into Selenium.

**Someone suggested having resident experts on different testing
frameworks to answer questions.**

Gavin Sherlock was suggested as the Perl testing expert. Danny Yoo
volunteered to be a contact for JUnit, Clover, log4J, PMD and testNG
(mentioned in the Java testing recommendation).

**On the topic of Logging and Debugging:**

Allen Day suggested using log4perl a very nice framework for debugging.

**IBatis VS Hibernate**

Jeff Bowes agreed on doing some use cases for IBatis and we have to find
some one who will take the responsibility on doing Hibernate use case.
Adrian from GeneDB is mentioned (volunteered). If these two volunteers
can agree on some common use cases and implement, the rest of the group
can then evaluate the technologies better.
