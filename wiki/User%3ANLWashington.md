I am a Research Scientist working with the
<a href="http://berkeleybop.org" class="external text"
rel="nofollow">BBOP group</a> at the
<a href="http://www.lbl.gov" class="external text"
rel="nofollow">Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory</a>. In my graduate
work, I focused on the cell biology of *C. elegans* sperm. My project
was a small-scall project, studying just a single gene. However, that
the single gene was related to an important gene involved in cell
membrane repair, and mutations in the human homolog could cause Muscular
Dystrophy. During this time I developed my sense of urgency for the need
of resources that link the research across organisms. My first project
in my post-doctoral years, I worked on the annotation of phenotypes with
ontologies, and ways to computationally compare annotations in model
organisms to humans. During this time, I was involved in the
<a href="http://www.phenote.org" class="external text"
rel="nofollow">Phenote</a> project, as both a software user, and as a
developer. Although this project is not currently funded, we are
continuing some support of the tool, and are seeking funding to continue
its development. We hope to better integrate this software into the GMOD
suite of tools. In my current work with the
<a href="http://www.modencode.org" class="external text"
rel="nofollow">modENCODE</a> project, we're using several GMOD tools for
collection, storage, and display of high-throughput genomics data from
*C. elegans* and *D. melanogaster*.
