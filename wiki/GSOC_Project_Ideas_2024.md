*Got an idea for [GSOC 2024](GSoC "GSoC")?'*

Then please post it. You can either

1.  Add it here, by directly editing this page. Just copy, paste and
    update the [template](#Template) below. This requires that you have
    or create a GMOD.org login.

Projects can use a broad set of skills, technologies, and domains, such
as GUIs, database integration and algorithms.

Students are also encouraged to propose their own ideas related to our
projects. If you have strong computer skills and have an interest in
biology or bioinformatics, you should definitely apply! Do not hesitate
to propose your own project idea: some of the best applications we see
are by students that go this route. As long as it is relevant to one of
our projects, we will give it serious consideration. Creativity and
self-motivation are great traits for open-source programmers.

## <span id="MP-BioPath_Perturation_Analysis_.2F_Stein_Lab" class="mw-headline">MP-BioPath Perturation Analysis / Stein Lab</span>

- *Brief explanation:* MP-BioPath is a computational tool designed to
  predict the effects of perturbations on biological pathways. Utilizing
  Reactome's pathway models, MP-BioPath employs an optimization model.
  Our objective is to develop pipelines and tools that integrate
  MP-BioPath results with genomic data.
- *Expected results:* As a result of this project, we aim to develop
  tools and pipelines capable of handling diverse genomic datasets.
  Additionally, we anticipate the generation of novel biologically
  significant insights.

- *Project paper reference and URL:*
  <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093%2Fdatabase%2Fbaac009"
  class="external text" rel="nofollow">"Evaluating the predictive accuracy
  of curated biological pathways in a public knowledgebase"</a>
- *Knowledge prerequisites:* Python, R, Julia
- *Skill level:* Medium
- *Project Time:* 175-hour approximately 8 weeks
- *Mentors:* Adam Wright \<adam.wright@oicr.on.ca\>

## <span id="Pathway_Reasoning_with_LLM_.2F_Stein_Lab" class="mw-headline">Pathway Reasoning with LLM / Stein Lab</span>

- *Brief explanation:* Reactome houses a meticulously curated repository
  of human biological pathways. Our current initiative focuses on
  crafting a RAG chat application optimized for intuitive interaction
  with the Reactome web portal. Our primary aim is to empower the
  application to interpret user queries and leverage the LLM (Language
  Model) to delve deep into pathway structures, enabling the generation
  of comprehensive and insightful responses for users.
- *Expected results:* expected outcomes include the application's
  ability to effectively handle a diverse range of user queries and to
  expand its capabilities to accommodate an increased number of use
  cases. Furthermore, the application is expected to leverage advanced
  reasoning capabilities powered by the LLM, thereby providing more
  insightful and comprehensive responses tailored to each user's inquiry

  any other particular computer science skills needed.
- *Skill level:* Basic, Medium or Advanced.
- *Project Time:* 90-hour, 90, 175 or 350 hours that are a standard 8
  weeks long and no longer than 12 weeks.
- *Mentors:* name + contact details of the lead mentor, name + contact
  details of 1 or 2 backup mentors.
