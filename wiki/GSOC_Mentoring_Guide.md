# <span dir="auto">GSOC Mentoring Guide</span>









For potential mentors: students work remotely and will typically
communicate with you electronically. Students are expected to be
self-motivated and responsible for getting work done. Your average time
investment is about one-four hours per week.

When a student contacts you, please tell the student a bit about your
project. Here's some questions you might want to answer:

- What software are you creating?
- Why is it interesting?
- Who uses it?
- What languages is it written in?
- How is it going to change the world?

Include any instructions or information about communicating, e.g. your
time zone.

### <span id="What_makes_a_good_GSoC_Project.3F" class="mw-headline">What makes a good GSoC Project?</span>

The following information comes from the
<a href="http://en.flossmanuals.net/GSoCMentoring/defining-a-project/"
class="external text" rel="nofollow">GSoC manual on what makes a good
GSoC project</a>. There are many ways to define a good GSoC
projectâ€”probably as many ways as there are student-mentor pairings. Here
are just a few:

**Low-hanging fruit:** These projects require minimal familiarity with
the codebase and basic technical knowledge. They are relatively short,
with clear goals.

**Risky/Exploratory:** These projects push the scope boundaries of your
development effort. They might require expertise in an area not covered
by your current development team. They might take advantage of a new
technology. There is a reasonable chance that the project might be less
successful, but the potential rewards make it worth the attempt.

**Fun/Peripheral:** These projects might not be related to the current
core development focus, but create new innovations and new perspective
for your project.

**Core development:** These projects derive from the ongoing work from
the core of your development team. The list of features and bugs is
never-ending, and help is always welcome.

**Infrastructure/Automation:** These projects are the code that your
organization uses to get its development work done; for example,
projects that improve the automation of releases, regression tests and
automated builds. This is a category in which a GSoC student can be
really helpful, doing work that the development team has been putting
off while they focus on core development. *source:

Prospective students are interested in "new" technologies and languages,
such as iOS and Android apps, and fancy, flashy, web-based projects.

### <span id="Project_idea_format" class="mw-headline">Project idea format</span>

## <span id="Name_of_the_Project" class="mw-headline">Name of the Project</span>

- Research Group
- Goal of the idea: describe the outcome of the project idea
- Brief description of the idea, including any relevant links, etc.
- Languages and skills: programming language(s) to be used, plus any
  other particular computer science skills needed
- Mentors: *name + contact details of the lead mentor*, *name + contact
  details of backup mentor*
