## <span id="Introduction" class="mw-headline">Introduction</span>

Tripal provides two Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that
allows developers to interact and customize Tripal and Chado content:

1.  **Tripal Themeing API**: allows customization of the look-and feel
    of the site through API function calls and template files.
2.  **Tripal Module Development API**: allows addition of new or custom
    functionality through module development.

The Themeing API provides an interface for developers who want to change
the look-and feel of their site. These developers may not necessarily
want to create new modules, but want to customize how their data is
presented. The first section in this handbook describes how to use the
API to make such changes. A knowledge of Chado and the relationships
between tables is necessary to use the Themeing API.

The Module Development API provides an interface for module developers
to interact with the Chado database as well as the other Tripal core
functions such as jobs management, materialized views, in-house
vocabularies. An understanding of the Drupal API and Drupal module
development is required.

If you find details in this document lacking, please subscribe to the
Tripal
<a href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/gmod-tripal"
class="external text" rel="nofollow">mailing list</a> and let us know!

## <span id="Using_the_Drupal_Devel_Module" class="mw-headline">Using the Drupal Devel Module</span>

Before staring your development work, it is suggested that you download
and install the
<a href="https://drupal.org/project/devel" class="external text"
rel="nofollow">Drupal devel</a> module. This module helps greatly with
debugging your custom theme or module. A very useful function of this
module is the **dpm** function. You can use the **dpm** function to
print to the web page an interactive view of the contents of any
variable. This can be extremely helpful when accessing Chado data in
objects and arrays returned by Tripal.

For example, each template for a node has a node object. If you want to
see all of the variables and record present in the node object simply
add the following to the top of the template file:

``` enter
dpm($variables['node']);
```

To see a list of all of the variables avaialable to your template you
would use the following:

``` enter
dpm($variables);
```

This function can also be used for debugging variables during module
development.

## <span id="Theming_API" class="mw-headline">Theming API</span>

### <span id="Skills_Required" class="mw-headline">Skills Required</span>

In order to use the Tripal Theming API to customize templates the
developer should have the following skills:

- Knowledge of PHP
- Knowledge of Chado and relationships between tables (at least tables
  where data of interest is stored).
- Understanding of the Tripal theming API
- Understanding of how Drupal theming works

### <span id="Best_Practices" class="mw-headline">Best Practices</span>

There are a few rules to follow when updating templates

1.  All development should follow standard Drupal coding standards:
    <a href="http://drupal.org/coding-standards" class="external free"
    rel="nofollow">http://drupal.org/coding-standards</a>.
2.  Do not use SQL statements inside of the template files. While you
    can do this it makes your templates longer and harder to read.
    Instead always try to use the Tripal API function calls as described
    below.
3.  Always copy the template files from the Tripal theme to your own
    default theme before editing. Try to preserve the directory
    structure when copying. This will ensure that future updates to
    Tripal will not overwrite your customizations. Drupal will prefer to
    use the templates in your default them rather than those with the
    same name in the Tripal theme.

### <span id="Brief_Introduction_to_Drupal_Theming" class="mw-headline">Brief Introduction to Drupal Theming</span>

Drupal is designed to allow for relatively easy changes to the
look-and-feel of the website. PHP code dedicated to the user
presentation is intended to be housed in special template files for site
developers to customize. The Drupal package comes with several themes as
part of the default offering, however thousands of user-contributed
themes are available for site-developers to download, install, and
almost instantly change the look and feel of their sites. A
<a href="http://drupal.org/project/Themes" class="external text"
rel="nofollow">Drupal Theme repository</a> is available for searching
user-contributed themes.

Each theme is physically a directory within the Drupal site that
contains a set of PHP template files, JavaScript and CSS files. Some of
the files in the theme directory are required and some are named
according to Drupal naming styles so that Drupal can properly find them.
For an in-depth overview of theming within Drupal, please see the Drupal
<a href="http://drupal.org/documentation/theme" class="external text"
rel="nofollow">Theming Guide</a>.

### <span id="Introduction_to_the_Tripal_Theme" class="mw-headline">Introduction to the Tripal Theme</span>

Tripal v0.6x-0.3.1b and later versions comes with a base theme. A base
theme is one which is not intended to be used as the default theme for
the site, but rather provides a set of supportive templates for the
default theme. The screen shot below shows the Drupal theme
administration page (**Administer** → **Site Building** → **Themes**) of
a demo Tripal installation. As shown in the screen shot below, the
Tripal theme is enabled, but is not default. In the example screen shot,
the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/sky" class="external text"
rel="nofollow">Sky theme</a> is default. Thus the primary look-and-feel
of the site is controlled by the Sky theme, and the Tripal theme only
provides a look-and-feel for Chado-based content:

width="800" height="464" alt="TripalDevHB-BaseTheme.png" />

### <span id="Structure_of_the_Tripal_Theme_Directory" class="mw-headline">Structure of the Tripal Theme Directory</span>

In a typical Drupal installation, the Tripal theme is installed in the
directory:

``` enter
   /[drupal dir]/sites/all/themes/theme_tripal
```

Where \[drupal dir\] is the location where Drupal is installed.

  
Inside of the Tripal theme are the following files:

- **tripal.info**: a file required by Drupal to identify the theme and
  specify location of theming components
- **logo.png**: a file of the Tripal logo seen when viewing the Drupal
  Theme administrative page
- **node.tpl.php**: a default template file when no other template is
  available. In practice this file is currently not used as each content
  type created by Tripal has a template file.
- **node-\[content type\].tpl.php**: a series of PHP template files use
  to theme specific Chado content, where \[content type\] is the name of
  a content type such as 'feature', 'library', etc. These names
  correspond to the same content types available when creating new
  content in Drupal.

  
Inside of the Tripal theme are the following directories:

- **tripal\_\[content type\]**: a series of directories with sub
  templates for each Chado content type.
- **js**: a directory that houses all of the javascript files for the
  theme. Each Tripal module has its own Javascript file.
- **css**: a directory that houses all of the CSS files for the theme.
  Each Tripal module has its own CSS file.
- **images**: a directory for storing images referenced by any of the
  template files.

  

### <span id="Themeing_Content_Types" class="mw-headline">Themeing Content Types</span>

Each content type in Drupal has two names, a human-readable name and a
programmatic name. When Drupal shows a content type (or node) for
display it attempts to find an appropriate theming template file by
using the programmatic name of the node. Drupal will look for a file
with the following name:

``` enter
   node-[content type].tpl.php
```

where **\[content type\]** is the programmatic name of the node type.
You can find the names of all content types in Drupal by navigating to
the administer content page: **Administer** → **Content Management** →
**Content Types** (screen shot below). A listing of all available
content types is provided and the programmatic name is given in the
'type' column of the table. For example, the
**node-chado_feature.tpl.php** file is the template file for the
chado_feature content type.

<img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/thumb/d/d4/TripalDevHB-ContentTypes.png/800px-TripalDevHB-ContentTypes.png"
srcset="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/thumb/d/d4/TripalDevHB-ContentTypes.png/1200px-TripalDevHB-ContentTypes.png 1.5x, https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/d/d4/TripalDevHB-ContentTypes.png 2x"
width="800" height="464" alt="TripalDevHB-ContentTypes.png" />

For the core Tripal package, the following content type names are
available:

- chado_analysis
- chado_feature
- chado_library
- chado_organism
- chado_stock

Additionally, several commonly used extension modules have the following
content type names:

- chado_analyis_blast
  (<a href="http://tripal.sourceforge.net/?q=node/22" class="external text"
  rel="nofollow">Blast Analysis Extension</a>)
- chado_analysis_interpro
  (<a href="http://tripal.sourceforge.net/?q=node/24" class="external text"
  rel="nofollow">Interpro Analysis Extension</a>)
- chado_analysis_kegg
  (<a href="http://tripal.sourceforge.net/?q=node/25" class="external text"
  rel="nofollow">KEGG Analysis Extesion</a>)
- chado_analysis_unigene
  (<a href="http://tripal.sourceforge.net/?q=node/26" class="external text"
  rel="nofollow">Unigene Analysis Extension</a>)

For any Tripal content type, either from the base Tripal package or a
Tripal extension a template file should be available for customization.

### <span id="Where_To_Put_a_Template_File" class="mw-headline">Where To Put a Template File</span>

By default, Drupal will search for a node's template file by first
looking in the module directories. In general, Tripal avoids housing any
theme template files in modules because when module are updated any
customization to theme templates will be overwritten. Next, Drupal
searches the enabled Tripal base theme directory and if it finds an
appropriate template will use it. However, if a template of the same
name exists in the current default theme that template file takes
precedence.

height="48" alt="Have-a-nice-day-icon.png" /> | **Best Practice Tip**. It is best to always copy any templates files out of the Tripal theme directory into your default theme for editing. This way, future upgrades to Tripal, that may change the template files will not affect customizations to your site. |

### <span id="Layout_of_a_Tripal_Node_Template" class="mw-headline">Layout of a Tripal Node Template</span>

Each content type provided by Tripal follows the same layout pattern.
Below is a screen shot of an organism page (chado_organism content type)
from the <a href="http://www.citrusgenomedb.org/" class="external text"
rel="nofollow">Citrus Genome Database</a>.

<img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/thumb/5/54/TripalDevHB-ThemeLayout.png/800px-TripalDevHB-ThemeLayout.png"
srcset="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/thumb/5/54/TripalDevHB-ThemeLayout.png/1200px-TripalDevHB-ThemeLayout.png 1.5x, https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/5/54/TripalDevHB-ThemeLayout.png 2x"
width="800" height="655" alt="TripalDevHB-ThemeLayout.png" />

  
In the screen shot above, there are two distinct regions added by the
Tripal templates. The first is the large content section on the
left-hand side of the screen. This section provides a display of the
data. The second region is the right sidebar that lists additional
**Resources** for this content type. This layout structure is created in
the **node-\[content_type\].tpl.php** template file for each node (for
this example, the node-chado_organism.tpl.php template). A more in depth
description of the code in this template file will be provided next. All
of the node template files follow this same structure

height="48" alt="Have-a-nice-day-icon.png" /> | **Best Practices**: If you would like to maintain this layout structure for any themes of new content types for new Tripal extensions, you will want to follow this same structure in your template files. See the next section for more details. |

### <span id="Dissecting_a_Tripal_Node_Template_File" class="mw-headline">Dissecting a Tripal Node Template File</span>

#### <span id="Template_Basics" class="mw-headline">Template Basics</span>

All of the Tripal node templates are identical in structure, although
each one is suited for the content it serves. Therefore, to demonstrate
the layout of the Tripal node templates, this guide will use the
**chado_feature** content type template as the example. In order to
understand where and how to edit the node template files, the various
sections of the **chado_feature** template will be shown and explained.
The following descriptions assume some familiarity with the PHP
language.

Each content type in Tripal corresponds roughly to a table module in
Chado. For a listing of Chado modules, see this page:
<a href="Chado_-_Getting_Started#Modules" class="external free"
rel="nofollow">http://gmod.org/wiki/Chado_-_Getting_Started#Modules</a>.
It is normally easy to identify which Tripal module, and hence which
content type corresponds to each Chado module as the naming is
consistent (i.e. Tripal stock module and 'chado_stock' content type
correspond to the Chado stock module). One exception is the Tripal
feature module and the 'chado_feature' content type, which was
inadvertently named 'chado_feature' rather than 'chado_sequence'.

Tripal exports automatically the data needed for each content type
template. Drupal makes a \$variables associative array available to all
templates, and Tripal adds data to this variable. Thus, in the
'chado_feature' template, the following line appears near the top of the
template:

``` enter
   $feature = $variables['node']->feature;
```

Tripal queries the **feature** table of Chado, as well as those linked
by foreign key constraints, and adds the results to the
\$variables\['node'\]-\>feature array. In the example code above, this
is simplified to a variable named \$feature.

#### <span id="Layout_Sections" class="mw-headline">Layout Sections</span>

As mentioned previously, the node template files have two major regions:

1.  a details section
2.  a resources sidebar.

In the template file, each of these sections is defined by **div** tags
with special CSS class names. First is the details section:

``` enter
  

   <!-- Basic Details Theme -->
   <?php print theme('tripal_feature_base',$node); ?>

   <!-- Database References -->
   <?php print theme('tripal_feature_references', $node); ?>

   <!-- Properties -->
   <?php print theme('tripal_feature_properties', $node); ?>

   <!-- Annotated Terms -->
   <?php print theme('tripal_feature_terms', $node); ?>

   <!-- Synonyms -->
   <?php print theme('tripal_feature_synonyms', $node); ?>
   
   <!-- Phenotypes -->
   <?php print theme('tripal_feature_phenotypes', $node); ?>
   
   <!-- Maps -->   
   <?php print theme('tripal_feature_featurepos', $node); ?>

   <!-- Sequence --> <?php 
   if(strcmp($feature->type_id->name,'scaffold')!=0 and 
      strcmp($feature->type_id->name,'chromosome')!=0 and
      strcmp($feature->type_id->name,'supercontig')!=0 and
      strcmp($feature->type_id->name,'pseudomolecule')!=0)
   {
      print theme('tripal_feature_sequence', $node); 
   } ?>

   <!-- Formatted Sequences -->
   <?php print theme('tripal_feature_featureloc_sequences', $node); ?>

   <!-- Relationships -->
   <?php print theme('tripal_feature_relationships', $node); ?>
   
   <!-- Feature locations --> <?php 
   if(strcmp($feature->type_id->name,'scaffold')!=0 and 
      strcmp($feature->type_id->name,'chromosome')!=0 and
      strcmp($feature->type_id->name,'supercontig')!=0 and
      strcmp($feature->type_id->name,'pseudomolecule')!=0)
   {
      print theme('tripal_feature_alignments', $node); 
   } ?>
     
  
   <!-- Resource Blocks CCK elements --><?php
   for($i = 0; $i < count($node->field_resource_titles); $i++){
     if($node->field_resource_titles[$i]['value']){ ?>
       -box" class="tripal_feature-info-box tripal-info-box">
         <?php print $node->field_resource_titles[$i]['value'] ?>
         <?php print $node->field_resource_blocks[$i]['value']; ?>
       <?php
     }
   }?>
   
   <!-- Let modules add more content -->
   <?php print $content ?>

```

In the example code above, taken from the **node-chado_feature.tpl.php**
file, a **div** block is created with a unique id name of
**tripal_feature_details** and the CSS class name is **tripal_details**.
It is the assignment of the CSS class **tripal_details** that gives this
details box the styling seen on all Tripal node pages.

Also, within this **div** block are several **print theme** statements
one of which is as follows:

``` enter
   <?php print theme('tripal_feature_base',$node); ?>
```

These statements instruct Drupal to load **subtemplates**. These
subtemplates are used to house the code for subcontent and are intended
to keep the primary node template concise and from becoming excessively
long. More on these subtemplates is described in a later section.

By default, some conditional logic is present in the template for
filtering large datasets. For example, the following **if** statement
only includes the **tripal_feature_sequence.tpl.php** subtemplate if the
feature type is not a scaffold, chromoosme, supercontig or
pseudomolecule. This is because those datasets typically have very large
sequences that would be too slow for the page.

``` enter
   <!-- Sequence -->
   <?php
   if(strcmp($feature->type_id->name,'scaffold')!=0 and
      strcmp($feature->type_id->name,'chromosome')!=0 and
      strcmp($feature->type_id->name,'supercontig')!=0 and
      strcmp($feature->type_id->name,'pseudomolecule')!=0)
   {
      include('tripal_feature/tripal_feature_sequence.tpl.php');
   }
   ?>
```

Finally, the resources side-bar is the last thing defined in the default
node templates. The code is as follows:

``` enter

   Resources
   <ul id="tripal_feature_toc_list" class="tripal_toc_list">
   
     <!-- Resource Links CCK elements --><?php
     for($i = 0; $i < count($node->field_resource_links); $i++){
       if($node->field_resource_links[$i]['value']){
         $matches = preg_split("/\|/",$node->field_resource_links[$i]['value']);?>
         <li><a href="<?php print $matches[1] ?>" target="_blank"><?php print $matches[0] ?></a></li><?php
       }
     }?>
     
     <?php // ADD CUSTOMIZED <li> LINKS HERE ?>
   </ul>

```

Here, the **div** block is given a unique name of **tripal_feature_toc**
and the class defined is **tripal_toc**. This **tripal_toc** class is
responsible for theming the resources sidebar to look the way it does.
Additionally, the title of the side bar is provided in the **div** block
with the class **tripal_toc_title** and an empty HTML list block, **ul**
tag, with the class **tripal_toc_list**. This empty list is where the
list of resources will appear.

You can add custom link to the resources side-bar by simply adding
elements in the **tripal_toc_list** block. For example, the following
screen shot shows the resources sidebar on an organism page of the
Citrus Genome Database. The **JGI Genome Assembly v0.9** link shown in
the screen shot is a custom link manually added to the template file, as
well as the **External Links** section towards the bottom. The code to
add these links is as follows:

Notice in the example code the link for the genome assembly appears in
the **ul** block with the class **tripal_toc_list**. This ensures that
the custom links will appear in the list where other Chado content is
added. But notice that the External links appear as a separate **ul**
block. Only dynamic content is added to the **tripal_toc_list** **ul**
block, so the external links list appears below.

Summary

In Summary, each node template file has two major sections:

1.  a **div** block defined with a class of **tripal_details** to serve
    as the container for content
    1.  this section contains include statements for subtemplates and
        logic to include subtemplates under different conditions.
2.  a **div** block defined with a class of **tripal_toc** to serve as
    the resources side bar
    1.  a title for the resources sidebar defined by a **block** with a
        class of **tripal_toc_title**
    2.  a list section for the resources sidebar defined by a **block**
        with a class of **tripal_tocl_list**

height="48" alt="Have-a-nice-day-icon.png" /> | **Best Practices**: A Tripal compatible template file should only have one **div** block for the details region and one block the resources side bar. |

#### <span id="Subtemplates" class="mw-headline">Subtemplates</span>

##### <span id="Description_of_a_Subtemplate" class="mw-headline">Description of a Subtemplate</span>

In the template layout section described previously it was shown how
subtemplates are incorporated into the principle template file. These
subtemplates are included using PHP **print theme** statements within
the details **div** block. For the feature content type of Tripal v1.1
the following subtemplates are available:

- tripal_feature_alignments.tpl.php
- tripal_feature_analyses.tpl.php
- tripal_feature_base.tpl.php
- tripal_feature_featureloc_sequences.tpl.php
- tripal_feature_featurepos.tpl.php
- tripal_feature_genotypes.tpl.php
- tripal_feature_libraries.tpl.php
- tripal_feature_nd_genotypes.tpl.php
- tripal_feature_phenotypes.tpl.php
- tripal_feature_properties.tpl.php
- tripal_feature_references.tpl.php
- tripal_feature_relationships.tpl.php
- tripal_feature_sequence.tpl.php
- tripal_feature_synonyms.tpl.php
- tripal_feature_teaser.tpl.php
- tripal_feature_terms.tpl.php

  
Each of these subtemplates adds to the details section of the page a
specific category of data. For example, the
**tripal_feature_synonyms.tpl.php** template will add a listing of
synonyms for the feature. And the **tripal_feature_references.tpl.php**
template will add a listing of external reference for the feature. Both
of these data are extracted directly from tables in Chado through
foreign key relationships. By default, the first subtemplate included in
the details section is displayed when the page is first loaded. Content
from the other subtemplates are then visible by clicking the links in
the resources side bar. These links are added automatically for all
subtemplates to the sidebar using Javascript described in the next
section.

height="48" alt="Have-a-nice-day-icon.png" /> | **Best Practices**: By convention, the default subtemplate (the one listed first) should have the word **base** in the template name. This is to easily identify it as a type of "home page" for the content type. |

All subtemplates for a content type should be stored in a directory with
a similar name as that of the content type. For the **chado_feature**
content type, a 'tripal_feature' directory exists. Any subtemplate
intended to incorporate data into the **chado_feature** template should
be housed in this directory. The same is true for all content types.

Each subtemplate file follows the same structural layout:

- A top section where variables are defined
- A **div** block of class **tripal-info-box** to define the container
  for the content. All data should be displayed within this block.
- Two internal **div** boxes:
  - One to identify the title of the container with a class of
    **tripal-info-box-title**
  - One to provide a description of the content of class of
    **tripal-info-box-desc**

The following code is taken from the **tripal_feature_base.tpl.php**
template and demonstrates the use of each of the required structural
elements descrbibed above:

``` enter

  <?php print $feature->type_id->name ?> Details
  
  [.... additional content here ....]

```

##### <span id="Adding_a_New_Subtemplate" class="mw-headline">Adding a New Subtemplate</span>

To add a new subtemplate to Tripal follow these steps

1.  Create the template file with a **.tpl.php** extension in the
    appropriate subtemplate directory. For example, to add a new
    subtemplate with content to appear on a feature page, add the file
    to the tripal_theme/tripal_feature directory.

2.  Follow the guidelines for the structural layout of the PHP code as
    described in the previous section. To access data from Chado, in the
    templates, follow the instructions in the [Accessing Chado
    Data](#Accessing_Chado_Data) section below.

3.  Add an entry in the appropriate **node** template file for this new
    template. For example, to add a new subtemplate to appear on the
    feature page, add a new entry to the **node-chado_feature.tpl.php**
    file. The entry should be an **include** statement such as:

        <?php include('tripal_feature/tripal_feature_mysubtemplate.tpl.php'); ?>

You may have noticed that here we use an **include** statement for the
subtemplate file rather than use a **print theme** statement as with
other subtemplates. This is because we are adding a single template
which is managed by a Tripal module.

|  |  |

height="48" alt="Have-a-nice-day-icon.png" /> | **Best Practices**: You should not need to add SQL queries to the PHP subtemplates. Use the Tripal API to access all necessary data. |

#### <span id="Template_JavaScript" class="mw-headline">Template JavaScript</span>

Not all of the subtemplates appear in the content section at one time.
Only content from one subtemplate will be shown at a time. The Resources
sidebar on the right is used for interactive cycling through the content
contributed by each subtemplate. This behavior is controlled by JQuery
and CSS classes. Below is the JavaScript code take from the
**node-chado_feature.tpl.php** template file:

``` enter
<script type="text/javascript">
if (Drupal.jsEnabled) {
   Drupal.behaviors.organismBehavior = function (context){
      // hide all tripal info boxes at the start
      $(".tripal-info-box").hide();

      // iterate through all of the info boxes and add their titles
      // to the table of contents
      $(".tripal-info-box-title").each(function(){
        var parent = $(this).parent();
        var id = $(parent).attr('id');
        var title = $(this).text();
        $('#tripal_feature_toc_list').append('<li><a href="#'+id+'" class="tripal_feature_toc_item">'+title+'</a></li>');
      });

      // when a title in the table of contents is clicked, then
      // show the corresponding item in the details box
      $(".tripal_feature_toc_item").click(function(){
         $(".tripal-info-box").hide();
         href = $(this).attr('href');
         $(href).fadeIn('slow');
         // we want to make sure our table of contents and the details
         // box stay the same height
         $("#tripal_feature_toc").height($(href).parent().height());
         return false;
      });

      // we want the base details to show up when the page is first shown
      // unless the user specified a specific block
      var block = window.location.href.match(/[\?|\&]block=(.+?)\&/)
      if(block == null){
         block = window.location.href.match(/[\?|\&]block=(.+)/)
      }
      if(block != null){
         $("#tripal_feature-"+block[1]+"-box").show();
      } else {
         $("#tripal_feature-base-box").show();
      }

      $("#tripal_feature_toc").height($("#tripal_feature-base-box").parent().height());
   };
}
</script>
```

When the page first loads, the Javascript hides all of the sub template
content with the following statement:

``` enter
      $(".tripal-info-box").hide();
```

It then iterates through each subtemplate and adds the title to the
Resources side-bar, adds a javascript function to each link to make it
visible when clicked, sets the first subtemplate as visible and adjusts
the height of the Resources side-bar.

height="48" alt="Have-a-nice-day-icon.png" /> | **Best Practices**: When creating a template for a new node, the Javascript code above should be duplicated, with names of the content and sidebar div blocks changed to match your content name. |

#### <span id="Accessing_Chado_Data" class="mw-headline">Accessing Chado Data</span>

As mentioned previously, Tripal automatically exports the data needed
for each content type template. The **\$variables** variable is an
associative array available in all templates. By default Tripal will
populate this variable with the record from the appropriate Chado table.
For example, for the **chado_feature** content type, Tripal will
automatically query the Chado **feature** table and add the record to
the variable. The record is then available in the template in the
following way:

``` enter
   $feature = $variables['node']->feature;
```

In the example code above, the **\$feature** variable now contains the
record from the feature table. The fields for the record can then be
accessed in the following way:

``` enter
   $name = $feature->name;
   $uniquename = $feature->uniquename;
   $feature_id = $feature->feature_id;
   ...
```

The following example code, taken from the
**tripal_feature_base.tpl.php** subtemplate file shows how these fields
are accessed and used:

``` enter
<?php

$feature  = $variables['node']->feature;

?>

  <?php print $feature->type_id->name ?> Details
  

   <?php if(strcmp($feature->is_obsolete,'t')==0){ ?>
      This feature is obsolete
   <?php }?>
   <table id="tripal_feature-base-table" class="tripal_feature-table tripal-table tripal-table-vert">
      <tr class="tripal_feature-table-even-row tripal-table-even-row">
        <th>Name</th>
        <td><?php print $feature->name; ?></td>
      </tr>
      <tr class="tripal_feature-table-odd-row tripal-table-odd-row">
        <th nowrap>Unique Name</th>
        <td><?php print $feature->uniquename; ?></td>
      </tr>
      <tr class="tripal_feature-table-even-row tripal-table-even-row">
        <th>Internal ID</th>
        <td><?php print $feature->feature_id; ?></td>
      </tr>
      ...
```

Within the HTML table structure, the fields of the feature are printed
in the location desired.

When populating the **\$variables** array, Tripal will also include the
records for all tables that have a one-to-one foreign key relationship.
For example, the **feature** table in Chado has a foreign key
relationship with the **organism** table. Because a feature can only be
associated with one organism (one-to-one relationship), the record from
the organism table will be added to the **\$variables** array
automatically. The fields for the organism record are then available
through the field that participates in the foreign-key relationship. In
the case of the feature table, this would be the **organism_id** field.
Therefore, you can access the organism fields in the following way:

``` enter
   $genus = $feature->organism_id->genus;
   $species = $feature->organism_id->species;
   ...
```

##### <span id="Accessing_Large_Text_Fields" class="mw-headline">Accessing Large Text Fields</span>

However, not all fields within a record are available by default. Large
text fields and one-to-many foreign-key relationships are not
automatically provided. If the text field is very large (e.g. residues
for an entire chromosome) or there are many relationships then it could
slow delivery of the web page to the user. Therefore, these are
purposely not included.

To include a large text field you must manually request it be added by
using the **tripal_core_expand_chado_vars** function. This function take
the following arguments:

- The associative array for the record (e.g.
  \$variables-\>\['node'\]-\>feature)
- The type of expansion to do (e.g. 'field', 'node', or 'table')
- The name of the field, node or table to expand. If a field, the name
  must include the table name as well as the field name (e.g.
  'features.residues').

The function returns the associative array, passed as the first
argument, but with the requested expansion.

For example, in the **feature** table the nucleotide or peptide
sequences are stored in the **residues** field. This is a text field and
not automatically included in the record. To get this information we can
expand the record in the following way:

``` enter
$feature  = $variables['node']->feature;
$feature = tripal_core_expand_chado_vars($feature,'field','feature.residues');
```

Using the example code above we are able to add in the residues
information to our feature record and then use it within our template
file.

##### <span id="Accessing_Records_from_One-To-Many_Relationships" class="mw-headline">Accessing Records from One-To-Many Relationships</span>

Adding information from a one-to-many relationship is performed using
the same function. For example, a feature may have more than one synonym
(one-to-many). The synonyms for a feature are stored in the
**feature_synonyms** table. We can therefore obtain the list of synonyms
for a feature with the following example code:

``` enter
$feature = $variables['node']->feature;
$feature = tripal_core_expand_chado_vars($feature,'table','feature_synonym');
```

Notice in the code above the second argument is **table** to indicate we
want to expand the record to include a new table, and the third argument
provides the name of the table: **feature_synonym**.

Unlike field expansion, records from a one-to-many relationship are
accessed using the name of the table. For example:

``` enter
$synonyms = $feature->feature_synonym;
```

The results from a one-to-many relationship are available as a single
value if only one record was returned or as an array if multiple records
were returned. Therefore, the following code example converts the
results into an array to make it easy to iterate over the results:

``` enter
if (!$synonyms) {
   $synonyms = array();
} elseif (!is_array($synonyms)) {
   $synonyms = array($synonyms);
}
```

Alternatively, you can force Tripal to always return results as an array
by passing the option **return_array** to the
**tripal_core_expand_chado_vars** function. Below is example code for
retrieving the set of synonyms as an array:

``` enter
$options = array('return_array' => 1);
$feature = tripal_core_expand_chado_vars($feature, 'table', 'feature_synonym', $options);
$synonyms = $feature->feature_synonym;
```

##### <span id="Working_with_Large_Record_Sets" class="mw-headline">Working with Large Record Sets</span>

When expanding tables in a one-to-many relationship it is possible to
return hundreds or thousands (or more) records. There are two problems
that can occur when large datasets are returned

1.  First, by default, when Tripal expands a record to include tables in
    a one-to-many relationship using the
    **tripal_core_expand_chado_vars** function it will automatically
    recurse through all of the one-to-one relationships and add new
    records. This allows you to have access to all of the data in Chado
    related to the primary data type. However, you can limit the amount
    of recursion that will take place. This is helpful if there are
    hundreds or thousands of records returned and recursing through all
    of their foreign-key relationships would dramatically slow the page
    load.
2.  Second, thousands of records can be too much to display on the
    browser, making the page load slowly or not at all. Therefore,
    limiting the number of result and providing a pager is desired.

The following code is from the tripal_featuremap_featurepos.tpl.php
template of Tripal. Here, the featuremap may be a genetic map and we
want to expand the featurepos table to include the features that are
found on the map. We do this with the typical
**tripal_core_expand_chado_vars** function. To reduce recursion and to
create a pager we have to provide some options to the
**tripal_core_expand_chado_vars**.

``` enter
$featuremap = $variables['node']->featuremap;

// specify the number of features to show by default and the unique pager ID
$num_results_per_page = 25; 
$featurepos_pager_id = 0;

// set the options for expanding the featurepos table
$options = array(  
  'return_array' => 1,
  'order_by' => array('map_feature_id' => 'ASC'),
  'pager' => array('limit' => $num_results_per_page, 'element' => $featurepos_pager_id),
  'include_fk' => array(
    'map_feature_id' => array(
      'type_id' => 1,
      'organism_id' => 1,
    ),
    'feature_id' => array(
      'type_id' => 1,
    ),
    'featuremap_id' => array(
       'unittype_id' => 1,
    ),
  ),
);

// expand the featurepos table to include map features
$featuremap = tripal_core_expand_chado_vars($featuremap, 'table', 'featurepos', $options);
$feature_positions = $featuremap->featurepos;

// create the pager.  
global $pager_total_items;
$featurepos_pager = theme('pager', array(), $num_results_per_page, $featurepos_pager_id, array('block' => 'featurepos'));
$total_features = $pager_total_items[$featurepos_pager_id];
```

In the options passed to the **tripal_core_expand_chado_vars** function,
notice first the **include_fk** element. Here we specify which fields of
the featurepos table we want to recurse. We want the type and organism
information for the landmark feature of the map. When Tripal expands
featurepos table it will see the entry for **map_feature_id** and add
the one-to-one record that for the feature that the FK relationships
indicates. Then it will continue to recurse and add the one-to-one
record from the cvterm table for the **type_id** and also add the
organism record for the **organism_id**. It will not recurse further
than those table. Normally, the record for the **cv** table would be
added as well via the **cv_id** FK relationships in the **cvterm**
table. But, because we did not specify to expand that relationship it is
not expanded.

The pager is quite easy to create. As shown in the code above, a pager
is created by including the **pager** option. It has subkeys the
**limit** (or the number of records to return) and the **element** which
is a unique integer identifying the pager. If you have multiple pagers
on a page then each one must have a unique element number. Finally, to
generate the HTML for the pager the following line is used in the code
above:

``` enter
$featurepos_pager = theme('pager', array(), $num_results_per_page, $featurepos_pager_id, array('block' => 'featurepos'));
```

Notice in this line the final argument is an array. Here we provide any
arguments to add to the URL when any link in the pager is clicked. As
described above, each element of the resources side-bar is managed by
JavaScript. If we simply refresh the page it will return to the first
element. When the user clicks on an element in the pager we want the
page to refresh and return to the same resource block. In the case of
the feature map page, the name for the block on which the pager resides
is 'featurepos'. When the **&block=featurepos** is part of the URL
Tripal will automatically show the resource div block requested when the
page refreshes.

To see a working example, visit the Tripal demo site at this page: <a
href="http://tripal.gmod-dev.oicr.on.ca/1.1/node/3637?block=featurepos&amp;block=featurepos"
class="external free"
rel="nofollow">http://tripal.gmod-dev.oicr.on.ca/1.1/node/3637?block=featurepos&amp;block=featurepos</a>

  

##### <span id="Accessing_Drupal_Node_Information" class="mw-headline">Accessing Drupal Node Information</span>

In some cases, a record may have a corresponding Drupal page (or node)
and we would like to provide a link to that page. For example, for
features, there is always a corresponding organism page. By default,
Tripal will automatically populate the node information for one-to-one
relationships. The code below shows how to obtain the node ID of the
organism to which a feature belongs:

``` enter
$nid = $feature->organism_id->nid
```

Even though the **nid** field is not part of the organism table, it is
always available in the record if a Drupal node exists. In one-to-many
relationships however, the node information may not be automatically
populated. This information can be obtained by expanding the record as
done previously. For example:

``` enter
$feature = tripal_core_expand_chado_vars($feature, 'node', 'organism');
```

Notice the second argument is **node** and the third argument is the
Chado table. Using this code, the node information will be added if it
doesn't already exists.

## <span id="Module_Development_API" class="mw-headline">Module Development API</span>

### <span id="Skills_Required_2" class="mw-headline">Skills Required</span>

In order to use the Tripal API for module development the developer
should have the following skills:

- Knowledge of PHP
- Understanding of the Drupal API

help understand the remainder of this document.

  

### <span id="Brief_Introduction_to_Drupal_Module_Development" class="mw-headline">Brief Introduction to Drupal Module Development</span>

Drupal provides an API for anyone to create new modules to extend the
functionality of Drupal. Tripal is itself a collection of modules that
use the Drupal API. The Drupal API can be found at
<a href="http://api.drupal.org/api/drupal" class="external free"
rel="nofollow">http://api.drupal.org/api/drupal</a>, but can best be
learned through
<a href="http://drupal.org/node/300614%7C" class="external text"
rel="nofollow">one of the Drupal books for sale</a>.

It is possible to add functionality to Drupal without strictly using the API. However, inappropriate use of the API can cause problems in the future when integrating with other modules or for upgrading. It is important to become familiar with the coding standards suggested by Drupal to ensure readable, re-usable code. |

  

### <span id="Components_of_the_Tripal_API" class="mw-headline">Components of the Tripal API</span>

Tripal provides several major groups of functionality through the API.
These include the following:

- Materialized Views API
- Controlled Vocabularies API
- Jobs Management API
- Chado API for selects, inserts, updates, deletes, etc
- Chado Schema API for obtaining Chado table structural information
- Analyses API for creating new analysis modules
- Module APIs (e.g. Tripal Feature module API, Tripal DB module API,
  etc).
- Views API for integrating MViews and Chado tables with the
  <a href="http://www.drupal.org/project/views" class="external text"
  rel="nofollow">Views</a> module

The Tripal API documentation can be found here:
<a href="http://tripal.sourceforge.net/docs/tripal-0.6x-0.3b/index.html"
class="external free"
rel="nofollow">http://tripal.sourceforge.net/docs/tripal-0.6x-0.3b/index.html</a>

  

#### <span id="Materialized_Views_API" class="mw-headline">Materialized Views API</span>

Materialized Views (MViews) are useful when querying the Chado database
is slow. Chado is highly normalized which makes it a great data storage
platform, but as a result can cause some queries to be slow. For web
visitors slow queries may not be acceptable. Therefore, materialized
views were introduced to Chado to alleviate search time. A materialized
view is essentially a new database table that agglomerates data from
multiple existing tables into a single table for easier access. The
materialized view is typically populated from a single SQL query. The
materialized view becomes a reformatted copy of existing data. Because
the materialized view is a copy of existing data it must be updated and
refreshed to include new data added to the normal Chado tables. For
example, the Tripal Feature module uses an MView to provide a count of
the number of sequence types an organism has in the feature table. Below
is the SQL query used for to extract this information:

``` enter
SELECT O.organism_id, O.genus, O.species, O.common_name,
   count(F.feature_id) as num_features,
   CVT.cvterm_id, CVT.name as feature_type
FROM Organism O
   INNER JOIN Feature F           ON O.Organism_id = F.organism_id
   INNER JOIN Cvterm CVT          ON F.type_id = CVT.cvterm_id
GROUP BY O.Organism_id, O.genus, O.species, O.common_name,
   CVT.cvterm_id, CVT.name
```

This query is too slow to execute for each visitor to the site,
therefore an MView would be an appropriate solution. In this case a new
table can be created called 'organism_feature_count' and populated with
the results of the query above. Therefore, the above query is only
executed one time, and the results needed to display on the page are
easy available through a much simpler select statement in the new MView
table.

Tripal provides a web-interface to allow a site administrator to create
a materialized view using a custom SQL query. A mechanism for updating
stale MViews is also available. However, Tripal also provides API
functions to allow for creation and management of MViews from within a
module. As an example, the SQL statement shown above is used to create
an MView that is automatically added by the Tripal Feature module using
the Tripal API. The functions provided by the API for manipulating
MViews is described below.

A quick link to the functions available in the MViews API can be found
here: <a
href="http://tripal.sourceforge.net/docs/tripal-0.6x-0.3b/group__tripal__mviews__api.html"
class="external free"
rel="nofollow">http://tripal.sourceforge.net/docs/tripal-0.6x-0.3b/group__tripal__mviews__api.html</a>

  

#### <span id="Controlled_Vocabularies_API" class="mw-headline">Controlled Vocabularies API</span>

Chado makes heavy use of vocabularies. For instance, the **feature**
table in Chado has a **type_id** column which has a foreign key
constraint with the **cvterm** table. The **cvterm** table is where the
terms from controlled vocabularies and ontologies are stored. This
**type_id** column is used to speficy the type of feature (e.g. gene,
protien, cDNA, etc.) Examples of publicly curated ontologies include the
<a href="http://obofoundry.org/ro/" class="external text"
rel="nofollow">Relationship</a>,
<a href="http://www.sequenceontology.org/" class="external text"
rel="nofollow">Sequence</a>, and the
<a href="http://www.geneontology.org/" class="external text"
rel="nofollow">Gene Ontology</a>. All of the property tables (e.g.
featureprop, analysisprop, stockprop, etc) use vocabularies. When
possible a public ontology or vocabulary should be used. Tripal provides
a mechanism for loading remote and local ontologies to the site
administrator. However, when an appropriate vocabulary is not available,
Tripal provides an API for adding custom terms that may be needed by a
module.

A quick link to the functions available in the Controlled Vocabulary API
can be found here: <a
href="http://tripal.sourceforge.net/docs/tripal-0.6x-0.3b/group__tripal__core__cv__api.html"
class="external free"
rel="nofollow">http://tripal.sourceforge.net/docs/tripal-0.6x-0.3b/group__tripal__core__cv__api.html</a>

  

#### <span id="Jobs_Management_API" class="mw-headline">Jobs Management API</span>

In many cases it is necessary to execute tasks on the website that may
take a long time. Usually, data loading is such a case. Often large
datasets are too big to upload, parse and load into Chado before the web
server will timeout and kills the job. A jobs subsystem was introduced
into Tripal to help with long running tasks. The jobs subsystem
maintains a queue of jobs and executes them in the order they arrive.
Jobs are executing via a cron command set by the site administrator to
run on a regular interval. Tripal provides API functions to allow a
module to add jobs to the queue for execution.

A quick link to the functions available in the Jobs Management API can
be found here: <a
href="http://tripal.sourceforge.net/docs/tripal-0.6x-0.3b/group__tripal__jobs__api.html"
class="external free"
rel="nofollow">http://tripal.sourceforge.net/docs/tripal-0.6x-0.3b/group__tripal__jobs__api.html</a>

  

#### <span id="Chado_API" class="mw-headline">Chado API</span>

Usually, developers of a new module will want to access and manipulate
data within Chado. It is easy enough to use the Drupal API to process
queries. However, Chado is well constrained by way of primary keys,
unique keys and foreign key constraints. This helps ensure integrity of
the data, but also requires a fair amount of checking (and hence
additional SQL statements) before inserting or updating a record. To
help alleviate and reduce the amount of coding, special API functions
are available through the Tripal API for inserts, updates, deletes and
selects of Chado data. These functions ensure that integrity constraints
are met before inserts and updates and provide results from queries in a
consistent manner.

height="48" alt="Have-a-nice-day-icon.png" /> | **Best Practice Tip**. Even though it is possible to query Chado without the Tripal API function calls, it is best to use them as it provides a consistent interface with Chado, reduces the amount of coding and makes the code more legible by all Tripal developers. |

A quick link to the functions found in the Chado API can be found here:
<a
href="http://tripal.sourceforge.net/docs/tripal-0.6x-0.3b/group__tripal__chado__api.html"
class="external free"
rel="nofollow">http://tripal.sourceforge.net/docs/tripal-0.6x-0.3b/group__tripal__chado__api.html</a>

  

#### <span id="Chado_Schema_API" class="mw-headline">Chado Schema API</span>

The Chado Schema API provides functions for retrieving the table
structure of any Chado table. This API is used by the Chado API for
selects, inserts, updates, etc., for checking integrity constraints, but
is also available to all modules. Every table in Chado should have a
corresponding function, and all table names can be retrieved using the
**tripal_core_get_chado_tables()** function call.

A quick link to the functions contained in the Chado Schema API can be
found here: <a
href="http://tripal.sourceforge.net/docs/tripal-0.6x-0.3b/group__tripal__schema__api.html"
class="external free"
rel="nofollow">http://tripal.sourceforge.net/docs/tripal-0.6x-0.3b/group__tripal__schema__api.html</a>

  

#### <span id="Analysis_API" class="mw-headline">Analysis API</span>

There are a myriad of different types of analyses that can be performed
on data stored in Chado, as well as a myriad of ways to present the
results. Therefore, Tripal does not include any analysis specific
modules in the base Tripal package. The design was not to lock Tripal
users into specific visualizations for analysis results. Modules such as
Tripal Analysis Blast, Tripal Analysis InterPro, etc are extension
modules that function just like other Tripal modules but are not
included as part of Tripal. Developers are free to create any extension
module desired for an analysis. However to ensure that all analysis
modules interact with Tripal in the same way a set of API functions are
provided.

Unfortunately, the API calls for this module are not yet completely
documented. Therefore a brief description of the necessary function
calls are provided below. See the example module files below for
examples of useful API functions and appropriate places to use them.

  

#### <span id="Modules_API" class="mw-headline">Modules API</span>

Each Tripal module may provide a set of functions as an API. See the API
documentation for the functions exposed by each module.

  

#### <span id="Views_API" class="mw-headline">Views API</span>

Currently under development is an API that will allow integration of all
Chado tables and MViews with Drupal
<a href="http://www.dropal.org/project/views" class="external text"
rel="nofollow">Views</a>. Drupal Views is a powerful querying and
display mechanism that allows the site administrator to create novel
queries and views of the data in Chado or a Materialized View without
using SQL or PHP programming. Filters for such queries can be exposed on
a page and used to create custom search pages for a site.

  

### <span id="The_Anatomy_of_a_Tripal_Module" class="mw-headline">The Anatomy of a Tripal Module</span>

Tripal modules follow the same directory structure as all Drupal
modules. The directory name is typically the same name as module package
name and contains at least three files with the following extensions:

- .info
- .module
- .install

The .info file provides details about the module to Drupal. The .install
file contains installation subroutines that are executed when the module
is first installed and the .module file contains the code that provides
the new functionality. For details about the appropriate Drupal API
"hooks" (or subroutines) that can be used within these files, see the
Drupal API reference.

For a Tripal extension module, the following should be present within
the .info file:

- the human-readable name of the module
- the unique project name of the module
- the package name set to 'Tripal Extensions'
- a list of dependencies which should always include 'tripal_core'.

For example, the following was taken from the .info file of the
tripal_analysis_blast extension module:

``` enter
name = Tripal Blast
description = An analysis sub-module for adding, editing, and displaying blast analysis results.
core = 6.x
project = tripal_analysis_blast
package = Tripal Extensions
dependencies[] = tripal_core
dependencies[] = tripal_feature
dependencies[] = tripal_analysis
```

In the example above, the human-readable name of the module is given by
the **name =** line. The unique project name of the module is given by
the **project =** line. As shown, the package should always be **Tripal
Extensions**. This will ensure the module appears in the **Tripal
Extensions** section on the modules installation page of the Drupal
site. In this example, there are several dependencies. These indicate
that the modules **tripal_core**, **tripal_feature**, and
**tripal_analysis** must be installed and enabled before this module can
be enabled.

#### <span id="The_Module_File" class="mw-headline">The Module File</span>

This section provides example source code to help begin a new module.
The code shown here provides a basic shell with the most common hooks
needed to create a new Drupal module. See the Drupal API and reference
manuals for information about how and when to use each hook. There are
no required Drupal hooks for a Tripal module. However, common hooks have
been included in the code below as well as comments for how to typically
use them for Tripal. The example files shown here are not comprehensive
of all functionality available through the API or within each
subroutine, but should be enough to get started.

#### <span id="Add_a_New_Node_Type" class="mw-headline">Add a New Node Type</span>

In some cases we want to create a new content type. We specify a new
content type anytime we need to create special pages to hold content.
For example, the Tripal Blast Analysis module creates a new
'tripal_analysis_blast' content type to display a summary of a blast
analysis. Essentially, this content type shows the contents of the Chado
**analysis** and **analysisprop** tables for a specific blast job. Below
are the necessary hooks needed to create a new content type as well as
the customary default code found in most Tripal extension modules.

``` enter

/**

The install file is executed only when the module is first installed. An
example .install file is provided below. To help demonstrate the use of
some of the Tripal API, some non-generic code is provided. Therefore,
you should customize this file to suit your needs.

   // is where any public files should be stored.
