## <span id="Prerequisites" class="mw-headline">Prerequisites</span>

Prerequisites are installed by JBrowse automatically. A few things may
fail to install (like legacy support for wiggle files), but that doesn't
matter.

Make sure you can copy/paste from the wiki.

It's also very useful to know how to tab-complete in the shell.

It's probably a good idea to use a browser like Firefox that has the
ability to turn off caching while working on this tutorial. To do this
in Firefox, with the browser open to the JBrowse page you're working on,
select Developer-\>Javascript Console from the View menu. In the
console, click the "gear" icon (settings) and check the box labeled
"Disable Cache".

## <span id="JBrowse_Introduction" class="mw-headline">JBrowse Introduction</span>

How and why [JBrowse](JBrowse.1 "JBrowse") is different from most other
web-based genome browsers, including [GBrowse](GBrowse.1 "GBrowse").

More detail: <a href="http://genome.cshlp.org/content/19/9/1630.full"

title="JBrowse PAG 2018.pdf">JBrowse presentation</a>

## <span id="Setting_up_JBrowse" class="mw-headline">Setting up JBrowse</span>

### <span id="Getting_JBrowse" class="mw-headline">Getting JBrowse</span>

JBrowse was put on the server via a tool called npm. For an exact set of
commands leading up to this [see the section below at the end of the
tutorial](#JBrowse_install_details). We'll pick up after getting the
JBrowse package downloaded and installed.

- Run the setup script to prep JBrowse:

<!-- -->

    ./jb_setup.js

- Start the simple web server for JBrowse:

<!-- -->

    ~/jb_run.js -p 8080 &

This starts a web server and puts it "in the background".

- download the demo bundle from Amazon (if we need it) and unzip it

<!-- -->

    cd jbrowse
    ##curl -O https://s3.amazonaws.com/jbrowse-tutorials/PAG_2018_JBrowse.zip #that's a capital dash "O" not a zero/zed.
    unzip PAG_2018_JBrowse.zip

### <span id="Starting_Point" class="mw-headline">Starting Point</span>

Visit in web browser:

    http://localhost:8080/

You should see a "Congratulations" page.

### <span id="Basic_Steps" class="mw-headline">Basic Steps</span>

There are four basic steps to setting up an instance of JBrowse:

1.  Load and format reference sequences
2.  Format data for tracks
3.  Configure direct-access tracks
4.  Index feature names

### <span id="A_Short_Detour_for_GFF" class="mw-headline">A Short Detour for GFF</span>

[GFF](GFF "GFF") (Generic Feature Format) is a very commonly used text
format for describing features that exist on sequences. We'll head off
to [that page](GFF "GFF") to talk about it a bit.

### <span id="Features_from_a_directory_of_files" class="mw-headline">Features from a directory of files</span>

Here, we'll use the
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Bio::DB::SeqFeature::Store"
class="external text" rel="nofollow">Bio::DB::SeqFeature::Store</a>
adaptor in "memory" mode to read a directory of files. There are
adaptors available for use with many other databases, such as
<a href="Chado" class="mw-redirect" title="Chado">Chado</a> and
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Bio::DB::GFF"
class="external text" rel="nofollow">Bio::DB::GFF</a>.

Config file: `pythium-1.conf`

    {
      "description": "PAG 2018 P. ultima Example",
      "db_adaptor": "Bio::DB::SeqFeature::Store",
      "db_args" : {
          "-adaptor" : "memory",
          "-dir" : ".."
       },
    ...

#### <span id="Specify_reference_sequences" class="mw-headline">Specify reference sequences</span>

The first script to run is `bin/prepare-refseqs.pl`; that script is the
way you tell JBrowse about what your reference sequences are. Running
`bin/prepare-refseqs.pl` also sets up the "DNA" track.

Run this from within the `jbrowse` directory (you could run it
elsewhere, but you'd have to explicitly specify the location of the data
directory on the command line).

    bin/prepare-refseqs.pl --gff PAG_2018_JBrowse/scf1117875582023.gff

Refresh it in your web browser, you should new see the JBrowse UI and a
sequence track, which will show you the DNA base pairs if you zoom in
far enough.

#### <span id="Load_Feature_Data" class="mw-headline">Load Feature Data</span>

Next, we'll use `biodb-to-json.pl` to get feature data out of the
database and turn it into [JSON](Glossary#JSON "Glossary") data that the
web browser can use.

In this case, we have specified all of our track configurations in
`pythium-1.conf`.


``` de1
...
 
  "TRACK DEFAULTS": {
    "class": "feature"
  },
 
 "tracks": [
    {
      "track": "Genes",
      "key": "Genes",
      "feature": ["mRNA"],
      "autocomplete": "all",
      "class": "transcript",
      "subfeature_classes" : {
            "CDS" : "transcript-CDS",
            "UTR" : "transcript-UTR"
      }
    },
   ...
]
```


`track` specifies the track identifier (a unique name for the track, for
the software to use). This should be just letters and numbers and - and
\_ characters; using other characters makes things less convenient.

`key` specifies a human-friendly name for the track, which can use any
characters you want.

`feature` gives a list of feature types to include in the track.

`autocomplete` including this setting makes the features in the track
searchable.

`urltemplate` specifies a URL pattern that you can use to link genomic
features to specific web pages.

`class` specifies the [CSS](Glossary#CSS "Glossary") class that
describes how the feature should look.

For this particular track, I've specified the `transcript` feature
class.

Run the `bin/biodb-to-json.pl` script with this config file to format
this track, and the others in the file:

    bin/biodb-to-json.pl --conf PAG_2018_JBrowse/pythium-1.conf

Refresh JBrowse in your web browser. You should now see a bunch of
annotation tracks.

#### <span id="Index_feature_names" class="mw-headline">Index feature names</span>

When you generate JSON for a track, if you specify `"autocomplete"` then
a listing of all of the feature names from that track (along with
feature locations) will also be generated and used to provide feature
searching and autocompletion.

The `bin/generate-names.pl` script collects those lists of names from
all the tracks and combines them into one big tree that the client uses
to search.

    bin/generate-names.pl -v

Visit in web browser, try typing a feature name, such as
**maker-scf1117875582023-snap-gene-0.26-mRNA-1**. Notice that JBrowse
tries to auto-complete what you type.

### <span id="Features_from_GFF3_or_BED_files" class="mw-headline">Features from GFF3 or BED files</span>

We're going to add a couple more tracks that come from a flat file,
`repeats.gff`. To get feature data from flat files into JBrowse, we use
`flatfile-to-json.pl`.

- We'll add a RepeatMasker track:

<!-- -->

    bin/flatfile-to-json.pl --trackLabel "repeat masker" \
        --trackType CanvasFeatures \
        --type match:repeatmasker --key RepeatMasker \
        --className generic_parent \
        --subfeatureClasses '{"match_part" : "feature"}' --gff PAG_2018_JBrowse/repeats.gff

- And then a RepeatRunner track:

<!-- -->

    bin/flatfile-to-json.pl --trackLabel "repeat runner" \
        --trackType CanvasFeatures \
        --type protein_match:repeatrunner \
        --key RepeatRunner --className generic_parent \
        --subfeatureClasses '{"match_part" : "feature"}' --gff PAG_2018_JBrowse/repeats.gff

Visit in web browser; you should see the two new RepeatMasker and
RepeatRunner tracks.

### <span id="BAM_alignments" class="mw-headline">BAM alignments</span>

JBrowse can display alignments directly from a BAM file on your web
server. Simply place the BAM file in a directory accessible to your web
server, and add a snippet of configuration to JBrowse to add the track,
similar to:


``` de1
     {
        "label" : "bam_alignments",
        "key" : "BAM alignments",
        "storeClass" : "JBrowse/Store/SeqFeature/BAM",
        "urlTemplate" : "../PAG_2018_JBrowse/simulated-sorted.bam",
        "type" : "Alignments2"
      }
```


This can be added by either editing the `data/trackList.json` file with
a text editor, or by running something like this at the command line to
inject the track configuration:

    echo '{
           "label" : "bam_alignments",
           "key" : "BAM alignments",
           "storeClass" : "JBrowse/Store/SeqFeature/BAM",
           "urlTemplate" : "../PAG_2018_JBrowse/simulated-sorted.bam",
           "type" : "Alignments2"
         }' | bin/add-track-json.pl data/trackList.json

### <span id="BAM_coverage" class="mw-headline">BAM coverage</span>

This time we'll use a text editor and will edit the track configuration
file directly. Type

      gedit data/trackList.json &

and insert the text below in the "tracks" array (the easiest thing to do
is find the "\[" after "tracks", paste there and then add a comma after
the "}").


``` de1
     {
        "label" : "bam_coverage",
        "key" : "BAM Coverage",
        "storeClass" : "JBrowse/Store/SeqFeature/BAM",
        "urlTemplate" : "../PAG_2018_JBrowse/simulated-sorted.bam",
        "type" : "SNPCoverage"
      }
```


and then press the Save button.

### <span id="Quantitative_data" class="mw-headline">Quantitative data</span>

#### <span id="BigWig" class="mw-headline">BigWig</span>

JBrowse can display quantitative data directly from a BigWig file on
your web server. Simply place the BigWig file in a directory accessible
to your web server, and add a snippet of configuration to JBrowse to add
the track, similar to:


``` de1
     {
        "label" : "bigwig_bam_coverage",
        "key" : "BigWig - BAM coverage",
        "storeClass" : "BigWig",
        "urlTemplate" : "../PAG_2018_JBrowse/simulated-sorted.bam.coverage.bw",
        "type" : "JBrowse/View/Track/Wiggle/XYPlot",
        "variance_band" : true
      }
```


This can be added by either editing the `data/trackList.json` file with
a text editor, or by running something like this at the command line to
inject the track configuration:

    echo ' {
           "label" : "bigwig_bam_coverage",
           "key" : "BigWig - BAM coverage",
           "storeClass" : "BigWig",
           "urlTemplate" : "../PAG_2018_JBrowse/simulated-sorted.bam.coverage.bw",
           "type" : "JBrowse/View/Track/Wiggle/XYPlot",
           "variance_band" : true
         } ' | bin/add-track-json.pl data/trackList.json

### <span id="Variation_Data" class="mw-headline">Variation Data</span>

#### <span id="VCF_tracks" class="mw-headline">VCF tracks</span>

JBrowse can also display VCF variation data directly from a VCF file on
your web server that has been compressed with Heng Li's bgzip and tabix.
Simply place the .vcf.gz and .vcf.gz.tbi files in a directory accessible
to your web server, and add a snippet of configuration to JBrowse to add
the track, similar to:


``` de1
      {
        "label" : "bam_variation",
        "key" : "VCF simulated variation",
        "storeClass" : "JBrowse/Store/SeqFeature/VCFTabix",
        "urlTemplate" : "../PAG_2018_JBrowse/simulated-sorted.vcf.gz",
        "type" : "HTMLVariants"
      }
```


This can be added by either editing the `data/trackList.json` file with
a text editor, or by running something like this at the command line to
inject the track configuration:

    echo ' {
           "label" : "bam_variation",
           "key" : "VCF simulated variation",
           "storeClass" : "JBrowse/Store/SeqFeature/VCFTabix",
           "urlTemplate" : "../PAG_2018_JBrowse/simulated-sorted.vcf.gz",
           "type" : "HTMLVariants"
         } ' | bin/add-track-json.pl data/trackList.json

### <span id="Faceted_Track_Selection" class="mw-headline">Faceted Track Selection</span>

JBrowse has a very powerful faceted track selector that can be used to
search for tracks using metadata associated with them.

The track metadata is kept in a CSV-format file, with any number of
columns, and with a "label" column whose contents must correspond to the
track labels in the JBrowse configuration.

The demo bundle contains an example `trackMetadata.csv` file, which can
be copied into the `data` directory for use with this configuration.

    cp PAG_2018_JBrowse/trackMetadata.csv data/

Then a simple faceted track selection configuration might look like:


``` de1
   "trackSelector": {
       "type": 'Faceted',
   },
   "trackMetadata": {
       "sources": [
          { "type": 'csv', "url": 'data/trackMetadata.csv' }
       ]
   }
```


Copy the section above and put it in the empty curly braces in the
`jbrowse_conf.json` file in the `jbrowse`, save it, refresh your
browser, and you should now see the faceted track selector activated.

## <span id="Changing_the_way_tracks_look" class="mw-headline">Changing the way tracks look</span>

Tracks can be modified by changing several aspects of how the images are
created. While this can be done be done both with HTML and Canvas
tracks, this tutorial will focus on Canvas tracks only (the repeat
tracks created above).

The configuration for the RepeatMasker track looks like this:


``` de1
      {
         "key" : "RepeatMasker",
         "trackType" : "CanvasFeatures",
         "storeClass" : "JBrowse/Store/SeqFeature/NCList",
         "urlTemplate" : "tracks/repeat masker/{refseq}/trackData.json",
         "style" : {
            "subfeatureClasses" : {
               "match_part" : "feature"
            },
            "className" : "generic_parent"
         },
         "type" : "CanvasFeatures",
         "compress" : 0,
         "label" : "repeat masker"
      }
```


Open the `data/trackList.json` file in your favorite editor
(`gedit data/trackList.json &` if you like) and Control-F will open a
"find" window; search for "repeatmasker". A simple change we can make is
to the color; in the line starting with "style", add:


``` de1
  "color" : "black",
```


save the changes and select the RepeatMasker track or reload the browser
to see the change. Many attributes of the display can be modified in
this way, see the [JBrowse Configuration
Guide](JBrowse_Configuration_Guide#CanvasFeatures_Configuration_Options "JBrowse Configuration Guide")
for a list of options.

### <span id="Making_changes_based_on_the_data" class="mw-headline">Making changes based on the data</span>

Much like GBrowse's perl callbacks that can change the track display, in
the JBrowse configuration file you can include JavaScript functions to
change the way tracks look. For example, in the RepeatMasker track, we
can change the color of the glyph depending on what kind of repeat it is
(where we happen to know that the type of repeat is encoded in the
name). In this example, we leave the glyph black, unless it is a low
complexity repeat, where we'll color it red. A function to do that would
look like this:


``` de1
  "color" : "function(feature) { var name = feature.get('Name'); if (name.match('Low_complexity') ) { return 'red'; } return 'black';  }",
```


When editing the trackList.json file directly in this way, the function
has to go all on one line, but if we create an "include file" (not
covered here) the function can have carriage returns in it. Replace the
simple "color : black" section we just created in the configuration file
with the function above, save the file and reload the browser page to
see the changes (you might have to mouse around to find a low complexity
repeat).

### <span id="Making_links_open_something_else" class="mw-headline">Making links open something else</span>

The default action when you click on a glyph is to open a "floating"
window that displays everything JBrowse knows about a feature. If you'd
like something else to happen, you have several options ([outlined
here](JBrowse_Configuration_Guide#Click_Configuration_Options "JBrowse Configuration Guide")),
including having a different floating window open or executing any
JavaScript function you define. For this example, we'll create a link
that will Google the repeat's name and open the result in a new window.
In the RepeatMasker section of the JBrowse configuration, we'll add a
section that looks like this after the style section:


``` de1
        "onClick" : {
           "iconClass" : "dijitIconDatabase",
           "action" : "newWindow",
           "url" : "http://www.google.com/search?q={name}",
           "label" : "Search for {name} at Google",
           "title" : "function(track,feature,div) { return 'Searching for '+feature.get('name')+' at Google'; }"
        },
```


If you're having difficulties, the RepeatMasker section of the
configuration file should now look something like this:


``` de1
      {
         "type" : "CanvasFeatures",
         "trackType" : "CanvasFeatures",
         "style" : {
            "color" : "function(feature) { var name = feature.get('Name'); if (name.match('Low_complexity') ) { return 'red'; } return 'black';  }",
            "subfeatureClasses" : {
               "match_part" : "feature"
            },
            "className" : "generic_parent"
         },
         "onClick" : {
           "iconClass" : "dijitIconDatabase",
           "action" : "newWindow",
           "url" : "http://www.google.com/search?q={name}",
           "label" : "Search for {name} at Google",
           "title" : "function(track,feature,div) { return 'Searching for '+feature.get('name')+' at Google'; }"
         },
         "compress" : 0,
         "storeClass" : "JBrowse/Store/SeqFeature/NCList",
         "label" : "repeat masker",
         "urlTemplate" : "tracks/repeat masker/{refseq}/trackData.json",
         "key" : "RepeatMasker"
      },
```


## <span id="Using_Plugins" class="mw-headline">Using Plugins</span>

JBrowse is built with a very flexible and powerful plugin system. There
is a
<a href="https://github.com/GMOD/jbrowse-registry" class="external text"
rel="nofollow">JBrowse plugin registry website</a>, and you can look at

plugins, <a

class="external text" rel="nofollow">plugins.yaml</a>.

For this tutorial, we'll look at a plugin that is shipped with JBrowse
but isn't turned on by default. JBrowse plugins are typically stored in
the `plugins` directory, and in 1.12.3's plugin directory there are 6
plugins:

     CategoryUrl
     DebugEvents
     HideTrackLabels
     NeatCanvasFeatures
     NeatHTMLFeatures
     RegexSequenceSearch

and the RegexSequenceSearch plugin is already activated (look under the
"Track" menu for it). We will turn on the NeatHTMLFeatures plugin. Right
now the Genes track has relatively "boring" glyphs composed of pink
rectangles connected by black lines. To turn on NeatHTMLFeatures, just
add

       "plugins": [ 
          'NeatHTMLFeatures'
       ],

to the top of `data/trackList.json`, just inside the first open curly
brace. Reload JBrowse and turn on the Genes track if it isn't already
and see the wonder of the psuedo-3D gene glyphs.

Note that not all plugins are activated this way: typically, if the
plugin modifies the way tracks look, it will go here. If it modifies the
way JBrowse \*works\*, it will go in the `jbrowse.conf` file.

### <span id="Highlighting_interesting_things" class="mw-headline">Highlighting interesting things</span>

To highlight a region, you can either right-click on a feature and
select 'highlight this', or you can set the highlight explicitly to a
certain genomic region by clicking "View -\> Set highlight" in the menu
bar.

Beginning in JBrowse 1.10.0 you can also highlight a region with the
mouse by clicking the highlighter tool (next to the Go button) and
clicking and dragging to highlight a region.

### <span id="Opening_local_files" class="mw-headline">Opening local files</span>

JBrowse can display GFF3, BAM, BigWig, and VCF+Tabix files directly from
your local machine without the need to transfer any data to the server.
Just use the "File -\> Open" tool from the menu bar to add tracks using
local files.

### <span id="Combination_tracks" class="mw-headline">Combination tracks</span>

Starting in version 1.10.0, users can define tracks that are
combinations of the data in other tracks. The operations used to combine
these tracks can be set operations (union, intersection, subtraction),
arithmetic operations for quantitative tracks (addition, subtraction,
multiplication, division), and/or masking operations to just highlight
or mask some regions based on data in another track.

To add a combination track, select "File-\>Add combination track" from
the menu bar, and drag existing tracks into the new combination track to
start combining them.

## <span id="Upgrading_an_Existing_JBrowse" class="mw-headline">Upgrading an Existing JBrowse</span>

If the old JBrowse is 1.3.0 or later, simply move the data directory
from the old JBrowse directory into the new JBrowse directory after
running the `setup.sh` script.

## <span id="Common_Problems" class="mw-headline">Common Problems</span>

- JSON syntax errors in configuration files (2.x series will stop this
  madness!)

## <span id="Other_links" class="mw-headline">Other links</span>

- Config file ref: [JBrowse Configuration
  Guide](JBrowse_Configuration_Guide "JBrowse Configuration Guide")
- DIV test: <a href="http://jbrowse.org/test/boatdiv/boat.html"

### <span id="JBrowse_install_details" class="mw-headline">JBrowse install details</span>

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get upgrade
    sudo apt-get install nodejs-legacy npm
    sudo apt-get install git
    npm install GMOD/jbrowse

This leaves two command in the home directory: `jb_setup.sh` and
`jb_run.sh`.
