Solanaceae loci with phenotypes</a>

The Sol Genomics Network ([SGN](Category%3ASGN "Category%3ASGN"),
<a href="http://www.sgn.cornell.edu/" class="external free"
rel="nofollow">http://www.sgn.cornell.edu/</a>) is a Clade Oriented
Database (COD) containing genomic, genetic and taxonomic information for
species in the Euasterid clade.

We have recently added to SGN databases of Solanaceae genes and
phenotypes, with a framework for simple and advanced searches by name,
function, phenotype, map position, sequence, and ontology annotations.
Phenotypes are represented as accessions of populations (mutants and
mapping populations), and may be linked to one or more loci.

Loci may be linked to one or more phenotyped accessions related directly
to the underlying gene or to a specific allele. Each locus and phenotype
have a curated page with internal links to other SGN information pages,
such as maps, markers, unigenes, and images, and external links to other
databases, such as GenBank, PubMed, GO, and PO.

An on-line submission and feedback pipeline allows authorized Sol
community-members to submit, edit, or obsolete database objects, data,
images, and annotations. These permissions vary according to the
user-type. The framework for editing the database is now being extended
for developing an online ontology annotation tool, and storing complex
quantitative and qualitative phenotype data.

The high level of conservation of genome organization in Solanaceae
makes the family a unique subject to explore the basis of its phenotypic
diversity. The small number of Solanaceae phenotypes with a known gene
sequence calls for a comparative approach for revealing gene function
and their associated phenotypes.
