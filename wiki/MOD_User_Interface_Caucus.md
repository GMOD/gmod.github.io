Jump to: [navigation](#mw-navigation), [search](#p-search)





The user interface (UI) of a MOD is very important to usability. At the
upcoming GMOD meeting (January 18-19 in San Diego at the Town and
Country hotel), a day will be devoted to discussing the UIs implemented
by various MODs by allowing each MOD to use their UI to answer a variety
of user questions. Note that previously we had referred to this as a
'bake-off' but have chosen to 'rebrand' it as a caucus to emphasize the
collaborative nature of what we want to happen at the meeting.

The goals of this meeting are for it to be a learning experience, to
identify what does and doesn't work well in various situations. Also, we
would like to come away with a set of UI 'lessons learned' which
hopefully will be useful both for developers of any GMOD-specific UIs as
well as the implementers at the various participating MODs.

We aim this as a sharing of experiences on how to best satisfy the needs
of scientists seeking genome/organism information. Presentation of
methods to arrive at how your MOD\[\[can best answer scientists
questions, more than a tutorial on how to use your MOD, is of interest.
We are expecting a varied audience of bioinformaticians and biologists
who work with organism/genome databases, or who are learning how to
start one. There may well be some drop-ins from the PAG conference.

We've chosen a set of what we hope are common and important questions
(below) that scientists asks of MODs: search for name of gene, searching
with broader concepts, extracting focused answers, and cross-database
facilitation. We hope most presenters can touch on these to give the
audience a way to learn the commonalities among MODs, but you may want
to focus a presentation on methods used to arrive at these, or talk
about your most interesting UI success. This doesn't need to include
engineering details, but user-centered design and testing methods are of
great interest.

At the end of the day, we hope the experiences you and others share can
be distilled by participants into approaches that will work well for
many MODs. E.g., a recommendation for all projects to add usability
testing, or to have common URLs for genome data, or to have common user
interface aspects to aid biologists who surf many MODs.

\[\*\]\] MOD in the generic sense of an organism/genome-related
database,  
defining the M as you would: Model, Many, or My organism.

The common user interface topics for presenters to answer are

- Search for name of gene, view information (gene page)
- Search for genes that cause a phenotype or GO association (ie, by some
  attribute)
- Generate a customized report on selected aspects of a gene
- Generate bulk output based on a query
- Combine the results at your MOD with information from other data
  sources
