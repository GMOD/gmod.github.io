## <span id="Summary" class="mw-headline">Summary</span>

Broadly speaking I am a molecular biologist who has converted to
bioinformatics. The first 10 years of my career I was doing molecular
biology and biochemistry bench work on problems associated with
translational recoding. Since 2003 I have mutated into a bioinformatics
geek. My work is currently focused broadly in the field of genomics with
projects in comparative genomics, genome annotation, biomedical
ontologies, personal genomics and human genetic variation, and high
throughput imaging. I am enthralled by the opportunities that are being
opened by the low cost/high throughput sequencing and imaging
technologies available today and thoroughly enjoy working on problems
that span the gap between wrangling the technologies needed to manage
large genomic datasets and pondering the biology that makes it all
interesting and relevant.
