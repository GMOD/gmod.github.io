This page provides a reference guide for "Desktop JBrowse" or "JBrowse
Desktop", which is a
<a href="https://electron.atom.io" class="external text"
rel="nofollow">electron application</a> that was unveiled for the
release of JBrowse 1.12.0.

The operation of JBrowse Desktop is comparable to other desktop genome
browsers like IGV or IGB, and it can be run without setting up a
webserver (most of the time normal jbrowse runs on apache and is viewed
in a web browser). In contrast, JBrowse Desktop is a simple exe file
that can easily be run locally on Windows, Mac OS, or Linux.

## <span id="Installation" class="mw-headline">Installation</span>

At the most basic level, setting up JBrowse Desktop consists of:

- Downloading a zip file script from jbrowse.org e.g. from
  <a href="http://jbrowse.org/jbrowse-1-12-1/" class="external free"
  rel="nofollow">http://jbrowse.org/jbrowse-1-12-1/</a> and OSX and a
  Windows version exsits JBrowse-1.12.1-desktop-osx.zip and
  JBrowse-1.12.1-desktop-win.zip
- After downloading unzip the file to somewhere. There is no official
  uninstaller but you can move it to the Program files or Applications
  directory as needed.

Note: on Mac, you can alternatively use Homebrew and run \`brew cask
install jbrowse\` which will download and place jbrowse in your
Application directory

  

## <span id="Overview_of_JBrowse_Desktop" class="mw-headline">Overview of JBrowse Desktop</span>

When you run JBrowse Desktop you will see a sort of "welcome screen"
that gives you several options

- View Volvox sample data
- Open sequence file, this allows you to open FASTA, Indexed FASTA, or
  .2bit
- Open data directory, this allows you to open a data directory that has
  been prepared with normal jbrowse tools

Note: it is highly recommended to use Indexed FASTA (selecting both a
fasta and a fai file generated by \`samtools faidx file.fasta\`) or
2bit. Even small genomes with normal FASTA will be much slower!

  

## <span id="Screenshot" class="mw-headline">Screenshot</span>

srcset="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/e/e5/Jbrowse_desktop_screenshot.png 1.5x, https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/gmod.github.io/main/mediawiki/images/e/e5/Jbrowse_desktop_screenshot.png 2x"
width="800" height="620" alt="Jbrowse desktop screenshot.png" />

This is the welcome page when you open up the jbrowse app. You can open
up sequence files such as fasta, 2bit, or indexed fasta here. Or, you
can open up a pre-existing jbrowse data directory. You can also see a
list of past "sessions" which can be revisited later. The red warning is
sort of awkward but it does not have any meaning here, it just means
that you aren't currently in jbrowse main screen

  

## <span id="Limitations" class="mw-headline">Limitations</span>

- The "Save session" function will not save some configuration
  customizations, so if you have advanced customizations it would be
  recommended to make a data directory by hand the trackList.json and
  tracks.conf format files
- If you open a data directory on the web, then "Save session" won't
  work

  

## <span id="Features" class="mw-headline">Features</span>

- Can open files from shared network folders and external hard drives on
  both windows and mac
- Can open files from remote URLs
- Can open data directories from remote URL
- Saves "sessions" to the OS "application data" folders
- Has a "home screen" that lists previous sessions

## <span id="Technical_details" class="mw-headline">Technical details</span>

The folder where sessions are saved is generally

- OSX - "~/Library/Application Support/jbrowse"
- Windows - "C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\jbrowse"

## <span id="Tested_platforms" class="mw-headline">Tested platforms</span>

- OSX Mavericks
- macOS sierra
- Windows 7
- Windows 10

Note: JBrowse Desktop doesn't work on windows XP and Vista (all electron
apps are limited to Windows 7+)
