## <span id="Other_Items_of_Interest" class="mw-headline">Other Items of Interest</span>

- [GMOD Summer
  School](2012_GMOD_Summer_School "2012 GMOD Summer School") -
  Applications are officially closed, but if you indicate you were at
  this workshop, you might get in on "stand by".
- [GMOD in the Cloud](Cloud.1 "Cloud") - An Amazon Web Services (AWS),
  aka "the Cloud", instance with lots of GMOD software preinstalled and
  configured.

## <span id="VirtualBox_Appliance" class="mw-headline">VirtualBox Appliance</span>

For this workshop, we will be using a VirtualBox appliance (or virtual
machine) that is running Ubuntu 12.04.
<a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads"
class="external text" rel="nofollow">VirtualBox</a> is a free, open
source application available for Windows, MacOS X and Linux that is
similar to Parellels or VMware. Please download and install the version
appropriate for your laptop.

The appliance should also be downloaded from the <a
href="ftp://ftp.gmod.org/pub/gmod/Courses/2012/ASPB/GBrowse_tutorial.tar.gz"
class="external text" rel="nofollow">GMOD ftp</a> site before the start
of the workshop. The appliance is 1.3 GB as a compressed tar file (which
can be uncompressed by 7zip on Windows or built in compression tools on
Linux or MacOS X systems) and is 3.5 GB when uncompressed. After
downloading and unpacking, you should have a folder called GBrowse
Tutorial. In that folder is a file called "GBrowse tutorial.vbox".
Double clicking on that file will start up the Ubuntu virtual machine.
If that doesn't work, you can also start VirtualBox and select "Add..."
from the Machine menu, and find the GBrowse tutorial.vbox file in the
open dialog. The Ubuntu appliance will start up and automatically log
you in as a user named "gmod"; the password for that user is also gmod,
which we may need during the tutorial.

## <span id="Tutorial_Flow" class="mw-headline">Tutorial Flow</span>

GBrowse 2.49 and all of its prerequisites are already installed on the
appliance. For the bulk of the tutorial, we will be following the
tutorial that comes with GBrowse and can be found via this URL when you
launch Firefox inside the virtual machine:
<a href="http://localhost/gbrowse2/tutorial/tutorial.html"
class="external free"
rel="nofollow">http://localhost/gbrowse2/tutorial/tutorial.html</a>
(note that if you click this link from somewhere other than inside the
virtual machine, Firefox will try to contact a web server on your own
machine, whether there is one there or not).

### <span id="Next_Gen_Sequence" class="mw-headline">Next Gen Sequence</span>

While we cover as much as we can in the standard tutorial, I will skip
around some and we will certainly not finish the tutorial. For the last
30 minutes, I'll switch to another tutorial to cover working with Next
Generation sequence data presented on a [separate wiki
page](GBrowse_Volvox_SAM_Tutorial "GBrowse Volvox SAM Tutorial").

## <span id="Thoughts_after_the_workshop" class="mw-headline">Thoughts after the workshop</span>

If we go to ASPB again, there are a few things I'd do differently:

- Try to figure out some way to get "compliance" on having VirtualBox
  and the tutorial appliance installed before we start--debugging
  problems with these during the class is a real "drag".
- Present a poster too to have a place to discuss with passers by.
- Rope somebody (CSHL people?) into being TAs to help the course move
  more smoothly.
- Charge a small fee to encourage registered attendees to attended (The
  workshop started at 7:30pm on Saturday night in Austin--which would
  you choose: GBrowse workshop or Austin night life?)
