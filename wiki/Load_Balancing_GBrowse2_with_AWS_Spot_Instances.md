# <span dir="auto">Load Balancing GBrowse2 with AWS Spot Instances</span>





From GMOD









Jump to: [navigation](#mw-navigation), [search](#p-search)





As of GBrowse version 2.54, you may offload some of the work involved in
rendering tracks to a farm of render slaves running under Amazon Web
Services. The render slaves use Amazon's
<a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot-instances/"
class="external text" rel="nofollow">Spot Instance facility</a>, which
provides servers for just pennies per hour, and the number of slaves is
automatically adjusted up and down in response to load.

## <span id="SYNOPSIS" class="mw-headline">SYNOPSIS</span>

Synchronize the data on the master with the slave image:

    % gbrowse_sync_aws_slave.pl -c /etc/gbrowse2/aws_balancer.conf -mysql /var/lib/mysql

Launch the balancer in the foreground

    % gbrowse_aws_balancer.pl --conf         /etc/gbrowse2/aws_balancer.conf \
                              --access_key   XYZZY \
                              --secret_key   Plugh

Launch the balancer in the background as a daemon:

    % gbrowse_aws_balancer.pl --background \
                              --conf         /etc/gbrowse2/aws_balancer.conf \
                              --access_key   XYZZY \
                              --secret_key   Plugh \
                              --logfile      /var/log/gbrowse/aws_balancer.log \
                              --pidfile      /var/run/aws_balancer.pid \
                              --user         nobody

Kill a running balancer daemon:

    % gbrowse_aws_balancer.pl --kill \
                              --conf         /etc/gbrowse2/aws_balancer.conf \
                              --access_key   XYZZY \
                              --secret_key   Plugh \
                              --logfile      /var/log/gbrowse/aws_balancer.log \
                              --pidfile      /var/run/aws_balancer.pid \
                              --user         nobody

Use the init script:

    % sudo /etc/init.d/gbrowse-aws-balancer start
    % sudo /etc/init.d/gbrowse-aws-balancer restart
    % sudo /etc/init.d/gbrowse-aws-balancer stop
    % sudo /etc/init.d/gbrowse-aws-balancer status

## <span id="DESCRIPTION" class="mw-headline">DESCRIPTION</span>

The AWS balancer scripts help you synchronize the contents of your local
GBrowse databases with a snapshot (or series of snapshots) on
<a href="http://aws.amazon.com" class="external text"
rel="nofollow">Amazon Web Services</a>, and to launch track rendering
slaves as <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot-instances/"
class="external text" rel="nofollow">Amazon Spot Instances</a> in
response to high load levels on the master server.

Load balancing is most convenient to run in conjunction with a GBrowse
instance running within the Amazon Web Service EC2 cloud (see
[GBrowse2_VMs#Getting_Started_with_the_EC2_VM](GBrowse2_VMs#Getting_Started_with_the_EC2_VM "GBrowse2 VMs")),
but you may also use this to supplement a server running on local
hardware. The sections below describe the configuration needed for these
two scenarios.

Note that you must have an Amazon Web Services account to use this
facility, and to install a small number of additional perl modules on
the master machine.

### <span id="Initial_Setup" class="mw-headline">Initial Setup</span>

1\. You must have the Perl modules VM::EC2 (v1.22 or later), and
Parse::Apache::Server::Status installed on the machine you intend to run
the balancer on. The balancer must run on the same machine that GBrowse
is running on. To install these modules, run:

    perl -MCPAN -e 'install VM::EC2; install Parse::Apache::Server::Status'

2\. You must have an account on Amazon Web Services and must be familiar
with using the AWS Console to launch and terminate EC2 instances. If you
run GBrowse on local hardware, then you will need to provide the script
with your access key and secret access key when launching it. It may be
safer to create and use an IAM user (Identity and Access Management) who
has more limited privileges. See CONFIGURATION below for some
suggestions.

3\. GBrowse must be running under Apache.

4\. Apache must be configured to enable the mod_status module and to
allow password-less requests to this module from localhost
(<a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_status.html"
class="external free"
rel="nofollow">http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_status.html</a>).
This is the recommended configuration:

    <IfModule mod_status.c>
       ExtendedStatus on 
       <Location /server-status>
               SetHandler server-status
               Order deny,allow
               Deny from all
               Allow from 127.0.0.1Â ::1
       </Location>
    </IfModule>

5\. If you are running GBrowse on local hardware, the local hardware
must be connected to the Internet or have a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
connection to Amazon.

### <span id="The_aws_balancer.conf_Configuration_File" class="mw-headline">The aws_balancer.conf Configuration File</span>

The balancer requires a configuration file, ordinarily named
aws_balancer.conf and located in the GBrowse configuration directory
(e.g. /etc/gbrowse2/aws_balancer.conf). On the GBrowse2 Cloud VM, this
file is located at /opt/gbrowse/etc/aws_balancer.conf.

The distribution config file looks like this:

    [LOAD TABLE]
    #req/s  min max
    0.1     0   1
    0.5     0   2
    1.0     1   3
    2.0     2   4
    5.0     3   6
    6.0     4   6
    7.0     5   7
    10.0    6   8
    15.0    8   8

    [MASTER]
    external_ip       =                # optional; will figure it out if needed
    poll_interval     = 0.5            # minutes between polling steps
    server_status_url = http://localhost/server-status    # URL on master that invokes Apache server-status

    [SLAVE]
    instance_type     = m1.large       # pretty nice performance, might also try medium
    spot_bid          = 0.10           # the pricing will cost no more than $0.10/hr
    ports             = 8101           # can be several space-delimited port numbers
    region            = us-west-2      # needed only when run from a non-AWS computer
    image_id          = GBrowse-2.54   # AMI of the slave
    data_snapshots    =                # EBS snapshot(s) to attach to the slave
    availability_zone =                # optional
    subnet            =                # optional
    security_group    =                # optional; will manage own security group if needed

The configuration file has three sections:

***\[LOAD TABLE\]***

This section describes the number of slave instances to launch for
different load levels. It consists of a three-column space-delimited
table with the following columns:

    <requests/sec>    <min instances>    <max instances>

For example, the first few rows of the default table reads:

    0.1     0   1
    0.5     0   2
    1.0     1   3
    2.0     2   4

This is read as meaning that when the number of requests per second on
the GBrowse server is greater than 0.1 but less than 0.5, run at least 0
slave servers but no more than 1 slave server. When the number of
requests is between 0.5 and 1.0, run between 0 and 2 slave instances.
When the rate is between 1.0 and 2.0, run at least 1 slave instance, but
no more than 3. Load levels below the lowest value on the table (0.1 in
this case) will run no slave servers, while levels above the highest
value on the table (2.0) will launch the minimum and maximum number of
slaves for that load value (between 2 and 4 in this case).

The reason for having a range of instance counts for each load range is
to avoid unecessarily launching and killing slaves repeatedly when the
load fluctuates around the boundary. You may wish to tune the values in
this table to maximize the performance of your GBrowse installation.

Note that the server load includes both GBrowse requests and all other
requests on the web server. If this is a problem, you may wish to run
GBrowse on a separate Apache port or virtual host.

  
***\[MASTER\]***

The options in this sections configure the master GBrowse instance.
Three options are recognized:

external_ip (optional)  
This controls the externally-visible IP address of the GBrowse master,
which is needed by the firewall rule for master/slave communications.
This option can usually be left blank: when the master is running on
EC2, then the IP address is known; when the master is running on a local
machine, the externally-visible IP address is looked up using a web
service. It is only in the rare case that this lookup is incorrect that
you will need to configure this option yourself. The external IP that
the balancer script finds can be seen in a log message when verbosity is
2 or higher.

<!-- -->

poll_interval (required)  
This is the interval, in minutes, that the balancer script will
periodically check the Apache load and adjust the number of slave
instances. The suggested value is 0.5 (30s intervals).

<!-- -->

server_status_url (required)  
This is the URL to call to fetch the server load from Apache's
server_status module.

***\[SLAVE\]***

The options in this section apply to the render slaves launched by the
balancer.

instance_type (required)  
This is the EC2 instance type. Faster instances give better performance.
High-IO instances give the best performance, but cost more.

<!-- -->

spot_bid (required)  
This is the maximum, in US dollars, that you are willing to pay per hour
to run a slave spot instance. Typically you will pay less than the bid
price. If the spot price increases beyond the maximum bid, then the spot
instances will be terminated and the balancer will wait until the spot
price decreases below the maximum bid before launching additional
slaves.

<!-- -->

ports (required)  
This is a space-delimited list of TCP port numbers on which the render
slaves should listen for incoming render requests from the master.
Generally it is only necessary to listen on a single port; multiple
ports were supported for performance reasons in earlier single-threaded
versions of the slave.

<!-- -->

region (required for local masters)  
The Amazon region in which to launch slaves. When the master is running
in EC2, this is automatically chosen to be the same as the master's
region and can be left blank.

<!-- -->

image_id (required for local masters)  
This is the name or ID of the AMI that will be used to launch slaves.
When the master is running on an EC2 instance, then the image ID used to
launch the master will be used. Otherwise, this option should contain
the AMI ID of a GBrowse image in the desired region, or a partial name
that will be used to find the correct AMI.

<!-- -->

data_snapshots  
Before launching the slave, attach EBS volumes created from one or more
volume snapshots listed in this option.Â :Multiple snapshots can be
attached by providing a space-delimited list:

data_snapshots = snap-12345 snap-abcdef

Ordinarily, this option is updated by the gbrowse_sync_aws_slave.pl
script and should not be manually edited!

<!-- -->

availability_zone (optional)  
This option will force the slave into the named availability zone. If
not specified, an availability zone in the current region will be chosen
at random.

<!-- -->

subnet (optional)  
If you are in a VPC (virtual private cloud) environment, then this
option will force the slave into the named subnet. Ordinarily the
balancer script will launch slaves into non-VPC instances if the master
is running on local hardware or a non-VPC EC2 instance. The balancer
will launch slaves into the same VPC subnet as the master if the master
is running on a VPC instance.

<!-- -->

security_group (optional)  
This specifies the security group to assign the slaves to. If not
specified, a properly-configured security group will be created as
needed and destroyed when the balancer script exits. If you choose to
manage the security group manually, be sure to configure the firewall
ingress rule to allow access to the slave port(s) (see the "ports"
option) from the master's group or IP address.

  

### <span id="Configuring_AWS_Credentials" class="mw-headline">Configuring AWS Credentials</span>

To work, the balancer and synchronization scripts must be able to make
spot instance requests and to monitor and terminate instances. To
perform these operations the script must have access to the appropriate
AWS credentials (access key and secret key) on the command line or as
environment variables.

While the script does its best to shield the credentials from prying
eyes, there is still a chance that the credentials can be intercepted by
another party with login access to the machine that the master runs on
and use the credentials to run up your AWS bill. For this reason you may
prefer to create an EC2 account or role with limited access to AWS
resources.

1.  Your personal EC2 credentials -- You may provide the balancer script
    with --access_key and --secret_key command line arguments using your
    personal EC2 credentials or set the environment variables
    EC2_ACCESS_KEY and EC2_SECRET_KEY. If not provided, the script will
    interactively prompt for one or both of these values. This is the
    simplest method, but has the risk that if the credentials are
    intercepted by a malicious third party, he or she gains access to
    all your EC2 resources.
2.  The credentials of a restricted IAM account -- You may use the
    Amazon AWS console to create an IAM (Identity Access and Management)
    user with restricted permissions, and provide that user's
    credentials to the script on the command line or with environment
    variables. The following IAM permission policy is the minimum needed
    for the balancer script to work properly:

<!-- -->

               {
                "Statement": [
                  {
                    "Sid": "BalancerPolicy",
                    "Action": [
                      "ec2:AuthorizeSecurityGroupEgress",
                      "ec2:AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress",
                      "ec2:CreateSecurityGroup",
                      "ec2:DeleteSecurityGroup",
                      "ec2:DescribeAvailabilityZones",
                      "ec2:DescribeImageAttribute",
                      "ec2:DescribeImages",
                      "ec2:DescribeInstances",
                      "ec2:DescribeInstanceAttribute",
                      "ec2:DescribeInstanceStatus",
                      "ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups",
                      "ec2:DescribeVolumes",
                      "ec2:DescribeSnapshots",
                      "ec2:DescribeSpotInstanceRequests",
                      "ec2:RequestSpotInstances",
                      "ec2:CreateKeyPair",
                      "ec2:DescribeKeyPairs",
                      "ec2:DeleteKeyPair",
                      "ec2:RunInstances",
                      "ec2:TerminateInstances",
                      "ec2:CreateSnapshot",
                      "ec2:CreateVolume",
                      "ec2:CreateTags",
                      "ec2:DeleteTags"
                    ],
                    "Effect": "Allow",
                    "Resource": [
                      "*"
                    ]
                  }
                ]
               }

Note that even with these restrictions, an unauthorized user with access
to the credentials could still launch a large number of spot instances
or terminate bona fide instances. This is just a fundamental limitation
of the granularity of EC2's permissions system.

#### <span id="IAM_Roles" class="mw-headline">IAM Roles</span>

Alternatively, if the master is running on an EC2 instance, then the
most convenient way to pass credentials is by assigning the instance an
IAM **role**. The balancer script can then obtain temporary credentials
by making internal EC2 calls. The credentials do not need to be provided
on the command line or in environment variables, and are only valid for
short periods of time, limiting the effect of theft.

1.  First, create an IAM role using the Amazon Console. Select
    IAM-\>Roles-\>Create New Role, and give the role the name
    "GBrowseMaster" (or whatever you prefer).
2.  Next, when prompted for the role type, select AWS Service
    Roles-\>Amazon EC2.
3.  On the Select Role Permissions screen, choose "Custom Policy". Give
    the policy a name like "GBrowseBalancer" and cut and paste into the
    Policy Document text field the permission policy listed above in the
    instructions for creating a restriced IAM account. Be sure to remove
    the whitespace before the beginning of the first curly brace, or the
    console will complain about an invalid policy.
4.  You only need to do this once. After this, whenever you launch an
    instance that will run the GBrowse master (typically from a GBrowse
    AMI), specify the "GBrowseMaster" IAM role name. This can be done
    from the AWS console's instance launch wizard, or by passing the -p
    option to the ec2-run-instances command-line tool. When run on the
    master machine, the balancer scripts can now be run without passing
    any credentials.

## <span id="THE_SCRIPTS" class="mw-headline">THE SCRIPTS</span>

### <span id="gbrowse_aws_balance.pl" class="mw-headline">gbrowse_aws_balance.pl</span>

This script launches a process that monitors the load on the local
GBrowse instance. If the load exceeds certain predefined levels, then it
uses Amazon web services to launch one or more GBrowse slave instances.
The work of rendering tracks is then handed off to these instances,
reducing the load on the local instance.

**COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS**

Options can be abbreviated. For example, you can use -a for
--access_key:

         --access_key   EC2 access key
         --secret_key   EC2 secret key
         --conf         Path to balancer configuration file
         --pidfile      Path to file that holds daemon process ID
         --logfile      Path to file that records log messages
         --user         User to run daemon under (script must be
                            started as root)
         --verbosity    Logging verbosity. 0=least, 3=most.
         --background   Go into the background and run as daemon.
         --kill         Kill a previously-launched daemon. Must provide
                            the same --pidfile argument as used when
                            the daemon was started.
         --ssh_key      Enable ssh login on the slave(s) using the specified
                            AWS ssh keypair. Login will only be available
                            from the host this script is run on.

### <span id="gbrowse-aws-balancer" class="mw-headline">gbrowse-aws-balancer</span>

The gbrowse-aws-balancer init script can be used on Ubuntu and
Debian-based systems to simplify launching the balancer at boot time. It
can be found in /etc/init.d by default, and is called in the following
manner:

start the service

    % sudo /etc/init.d/gbrowse-aws-balancer start

stop the service

    % sudo /etc/init.d/gbrowse-aws-balancer stop

stop and restart the service

    % sudo /etc/init.d/gbrowse-aws-balancer restart

show the status of the service (running, stopped)

    % sudo /etc/init.d/gbrowse-aws-balancer status

The various script options are all set in a single configuration file
named /etc/default/gbrowse-aws-balancer. The distribution contents of
this file looks like this:

    DAEMON=/usr/local/bin/gbrowse_aws_balancer.pl
    USER=www-data
    RUNDIR=/var/run/gbrowse2
    LOGDIR=/var/log/gbrowse2
    CONFFILE=/etc/gbrowse2/aws_balancer.conf
    ACCESS_KEY=YOUR_EC2_ACCESS_KEY_HERE
    SECRET_KEY=YOUR_EC2_SECRET_KEY_HERE
    VERBOSITY=3

The variables in this file set the location of the balancer script, the
location of its configuration file, the verbosity to run with, and where
to write the script's process ID and log information. In addition, you
can place your (or another authorized user's) EC2 access and secret key
in this file. Please make sure that this file is only readable by root.

### <span id="gbrowse_sync_aws_slave.pl" class="mw-headline">gbrowse_sync_aws_slave.pl</span>

The gbrowse_sync_aws_script.pl script should be run on the master each
time you add a new database to an existing data source, or if you add a
whole new data source. What it does is to prepare a new Amazon EBS
snapshot containing a copy of all the data needed for the GBrowse slave
to run. This snapshot is then attached to new slave instances.

After running, it updates the conf file with the current versions of the
slave AMI and the data snapshot.

    % sudo gbrowse_sync_aws_script.pl --conf     /etc/gbrowse2/aws_balancer.conf \
                                      --mysql    /var/lib/mysql \
                                      --postgres /var/lib/postgresql

The --conf argument is required. The script will create a snapshot of
the appropriate size, mount it on a temporary staging instance, and
rsync a copy of your gbrowse databases directory (e.g.
/var/lib/gbrowse2/databases) to the snapshot. If you have created mysql
or postgres databases, you must also give the paths to their database
file directories, as shown in the example.

Note that ALL your mysql and postgres data files located on the server
will be copied; not just those used for track display.

### <span id="Environment_Variables" class="mw-headline">Environment Variables</span>

The following environment variables are used by gbrowse_aws_balancer.pl
and gbrowse_sync_aws_slave.pl if the corresponding command line options
are not present:

    EC2_ACCESS_KEY     AWS EC2 access key
    EC2_SECRET_KEY     AWS EC2 secret key

If slaves are returning track renderinge errors, then there is likely an
issue with data synchronization. This typically happens when the data on
the master differs from the data on the slave, or path names are
different on the two systems.

To debug this, launch gbrowse_aws_balancer.pl with the -ssh_key option:

    Â % gbrowse_aws_balancer.pl --conf         /etc/gbrowse2/aws_balancer.conf \
                              --access_key   XYZZY \
                              --secret_key   Plugh \
                              --ssh_key      John_Doe_default

You may then ssh into the slave using the specified ssh key and the
username "admin". A useful thing to do is to tail the slave log file:

    ssh -i .ssh/John_Doe_default admin@54.280.19.203 tail -f /var/log/gbrowse/gbrowse_slave

Replace the IP number with the correct IP number of one of the running
slaves, which you can find in /etc/gbrowse2/renderfarm.conf.
