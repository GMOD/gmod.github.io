Because GMOD is a large and diverse collection of projects, it can be
difficult to find the right place to ask a question. GMOD support is
available from several different sources. This page introduces each
support option and offers guidance on which one is the most appropriate
for your question.

## <span id="GMOD_Web_Site" class="mw-headline">GMOD Web Site</span>

Many questions about GMOD can be answered by [searching this
website](Special:Search "Special:Search") or exploring it through
[category tags](Categories "Categories"). Some pages that are
particularly useful places to start for support questions:

- [Overview](Overview "Overview") - an introduction to GMOD.
- [FAQs](Category%3AFAQ "Category%3AFAQ") - List of Frequently Asked
  Questions pages.
- [GMOD Components](GMOD_Components "GMOD Components") - Links to pages
  about each of the GMOD components.
- [Glossary](Glossary "Glossary") - List of commonly used terms in GMOD.
- [HOWTOs](Category%3AHOWTO "Category%3AHOWTO") - List of HOWTO pages

## <span id="GMOD_Mailing_Lists" class="mw-headline">[GMOD Mailing Lists](GMOD_Mailing_Lists "GMOD Mailing Lists")</span>

The GMOD project has many [mailing
lists](GMOD_Mailing_Lists "GMOD Mailing Lists") and if one exists on
your topic of interest then that mailing list is often the best place to
start. First, search the list archives to see if your question has
already been asked and answered. If it hasn't then subscribe to the list
and then post your question. (Most GMOD mailing lists are
subscriber-only to cut down on spam.)

See [GMOD Mailing Lists](GMOD_Mailing_Lists "GMOD Mailing Lists") for
links to and descriptions of most of the GMOD mailing lists that are
geared towards GMOD users. This includes both project wide and component
specific mailing lists.

### <span id="Which_List.3F" class="mw-headline">Which List?</span>

If your question is about how
<a href="Chado" class="mw-redirect" title="Chado">Chado</a> and another
component like [GBrowse](GBrowse.1 "GBrowse") and
[Apollo](Apollo.1 "Apollo") interact, it is best to subscribe and post
the question to both the Chado and the component lists.

For applications that don't have a dedicated mailing list, you can post
your question to the
<a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/gmod-devel"
class="external text" rel="nofollow">general GMOD developers mailing
list</a> which is fairly low traffic but there is a good chance that you
would at least get directed to the right person to ask a question.

If you are interested in mailing lists for component developers, see
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=27707"
class="external text" rel="nofollow">SourceForge</a>.

If it is not clear where to send your question you can send it to the
[GMOD Help Desk](GMOD_Help_Desk "GMOD Help Desk").

## <span id="GMOD_Help_Desk" class="mw-headline">GMOD Help Desk</span>

The [GMOD Help Desk](GMOD_Help_Desk "GMOD Help Desk") is also available
to answer your support questions (or at least refer you to the people
who can). In addition to e-mail support the help desk also offers other
services such as onsite support and user training. See [GMOD Help
Desk](GMOD_Help_Desk "GMOD Help Desk") for more.

## <span id="Meetings_and_Training_and_Outreach" class="mw-headline">[Meetings](Meetings "Meetings") and [Training and Outreach](Training_and_Outreach "Training and Outreach")</span>

You can also get (and give) support at [GMOD
meetings](Meetings "Meetings") and at [GMOD sponsored and related
workshops](Training_and_Outreach "Training and Outreach"). Meetings and
workshops are always listed on the GMOD [Calendar](Calendar "Calendar")
and are often announced on the [GMOD News](GMOD_News "GMOD News") page
and GMOD-Announce [mailing
list](GMOD_Mailing_Lists "GMOD Mailing Lists").

[GMOD Schools](GMOD_Schools "GMOD Schools") are held about once a year
and offer hands-on training on installing, configuring and integrating
GMOD components.
