[Rob Buels](User%3ARobertBuels "User%3ARobertBuels") ran the conversion on
September 15, 2009. The conversion finished around 12:45pm, Eastern US.
See <a href="Subversion" class="mw-redirect"
title="Subversion">Subversion</a> for how to access the new repository.
We spent the rest of the day locking down CVS access (it is still there,
but is read-only), and updating this website to refer to
<a href="SVN" class="mw-redirect" title="SVN">SVN</a> instead of CVS.

## <span id="Outstanding_Issues" class="mw-headline">Outstanding Issues</span>

We do have a few unfinished items, and we expect a few bumps to pop up
over the coming weeks. We'll keep track of those problems here. Thus far
we have identified 2 issues. If you find any more, please add them here,
or email them to the
<a href="mailto:help@gmod.org" class="external text" rel="nofollow">GMOD
Help Desk</a>.

| Issue Name | Description | Status |
|----|----|----|
| Commit Mailing Lists | Several [GMOD Mailing Lists](GMOD_Mailing_Lists "GMOD Mailing Lists") exist that automatically sent out emails whenever a commit was made to a CVS project. Need to create new lists or modify existing ones to read from SVN instead. | Work is under way. GBrowse, Schema, and Apollo have been set up. |
| [GBrowse](GBrowse.1 "GBrowse") net installer | The GBrowse net install program gets GBrowse from CVS. Needs to now get it from SVN | Fixed in the STABLE branch |

## <span id="Announcement" class="mw-headline">Announcement</span>

GMOD's CVS source code repository will be converted to Subversion (SVN)
on September 15, 2009. [Rob Buels](User%3ARobertBuels "User%3ARobertBuels")
of Cornell / [SGN](Category%3ASGN "Category%3ASGN") has generously offered
to to do this. The discussion leading up to this decision on the
<a href="http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.science.biology.gmod.devel/364"
class="external text" rel="nofollow">GMOD Developers mailing list</a>.

*If you are not a GMOD developer then this will, at most, change how you
get pre-release copies of GMOD components.* In the future you will do
SVN checkouts instead of CVS checkouts. The doc on this web site will be
updated to describe how to do this.

<div class="emphasisbox">

**If you are a GMOD developer and your project is in GMOD's CVS
repository then this move will significantly affect you.**

</div>

See
<a href="http://gmod.cvs.sourceforge.net/gmod/" class="external text"
rel="nofollow">SourceForge</a> for a complete list of projects in GMOD
CVS. This list is reproduced below. We have contacted all project
developers to confirm what projects are still active. All projects will
be moved to SVN, but any projects that are no longer active will be
placed in a separate archive directory. This will significantly clean up
the repository. See below for the future SVN status of each project.

Rob has created a
<a href="http://bugs.sgn.cornell.edu/trac/gmod_test_svn/browser/"
class="external text" rel="nofollow">preview version of the
repository</a>. Feel free to poke around. This version does not have any
projects archived.

Rob will move the projects on September 15. **Everyone with uncommitted
code changes should commit them to CVS by 3am, Eastern US time, on
September 15.** Rob will notify folks once the move is complete. After
September 15, all CVS checkouts you have should be removed and new
checkouts made with SVN. We'll provide doc on how to do this.

Please let Rob and Dave know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

[Dave Clements](User%3AClements "User%3AClements") and [Rob
Buels](User%3ARobertBuels "User%3ARobertBuels")

## <span id="Projects" class="mw-headline">Projects</span>

All projects will be moved, but some will be taken out of the active
repository and put in an `attic, archive,` or `frozen_projects`
directory.

This table keeps track of our efforts to identify which of the many
projects are still active.
